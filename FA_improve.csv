"""Get a better personality!""","What does it actually mean to improve your personality? Becoming kinder? But then you become a nice guy.

Become more aggressive? Then you become an asshole.

Become confident? Then you become a narccisst.

Become humble? Then you become a doormat.

Become honest? Then you become insensitive.

Become deceitful? Then you become untrustworthy.

Become funny? Wake me up when people have come up with a coherent definition of what humour is, let alone a clear and coherent guide on how to do it consistently.

Just be yourself? That's what I'm doing right now.

Because the thing is, all of this gets flipped on its head when you're good-looking.

When attractive people do kind things, they aren't nice guys, they're altruistic.

When attractive people act aggressive, they aren't assholes, they're assertive.

When attractive people act confident, they aren't narcissists, they're self-assured.

When attractive people act humble, they aren't doormats, they're modest.

When attractive people are honest, they aren't insenstive, they're giving out tough love.

When attractive people are decietful, they aren't untrustworthy, they're tactful.

And attractive people can say, ""Why did the chicken cross the road? ""And people will laugh before hearing the punch line. Because there is no logic or theory or formula behind humour, its an unconscious biological process.","['I’m always amazed by how much attractive people can get away with and how people automatically think they’re “good” people.

You can still take steps to have a balanced, attractive personality though, but you shouldn't have to force it.

The ""nice guy"" phenomena is more to do with people not liking it when people view kindness as a means to an end - an exchange. People don\'t like it when someone is ""kind"" just to get pussy or just so people owe them or just to get promoted or just to get popular, etc. People want people to be kind just for the sake of it (but the unspoken truth that everyone knows is that no one is kind just for the sake of it). But obviously people can\'t read minds. There\'s no way of 100% determining the underlying motivations behind people\'s actions. \n\nSo people rely on their biases to determine those underlying motivations as a way of rationalizing their superificial subconscious biases that are formed by how physically attractive a person is. In other words, the halo effect.', 'There is no such thing as an overall balanced and attractive personality. Because as you said, everyone has their own unique personal biases. There is no way of pleasing everyone - except by being physically attractive - the standards of which is mostly consistent across cultures.', ""In extreme scenarios then obviously attractiveness won't save you. If you kill someone's entire family then they're obviously gonna think you're an awful person (but bare in mind lots of serial killers have lots of fan girls). But most assholes you meet in life are considered assholes due to more subtle and less extreme behaviour.\n\nFor example, if an ugly person repeatedly interrupted someone in a debate, then that person would be considered rude and obnoxious. But if an attractive person repeatedly interrupted someone in a debate, then they'd be considered assertive and confident. Becuase interupting someone isn't always a bad thing to do in a debate, sometimes it's nessecary to cut someone off so you don't let them steam roll you and you get a chance to speak. But it's also sometimes the wrong thing to do because you're not letting the other person a chance to speak. The subjectivity of the matter allows people to resolve the cognitive dissonance of finding the person attractive but disliking the fact that they keep interrupting someone by pulling off mental gymnastics to justify the person in question interrupting people in debates.\n\nThe idea of never stepping on people is the opposite of being assertive. Being assertive is all about moderately stepping on people in order to get what you want without hurting people too much, but being assertive still means you're hurting people to a certain degree. Assertiveness is the golden mean between being a doormat and being an asshole. E.g. interrupting someone in a debate/argument, leveraging other job oppurtunities when asking for a promotion, making a complaint about a broken product, refusing to let people in your life step over your boundaries. All of those things require you to sacrifice other people's wants for you own, but are things that you sometimes need to do in life in order to get what you want, but can also have ambiguous morality is different situations. If you take any of them too far then they can make you an asshole, and if you do any of them too little then you end up being a doormat. \n\nMorality isn't always as clear cut as you make it. Most people are a shade of grey. And whether that grey is intepreted to be a light grey or a dark grey depends on their first impressions of you due to the halo effect (and the first thing most people will notice about you is how you look)."", 'I’ve noticed it’s really as simple as how you’ve primarily been treated in the past. Example: I’ve mostly always been laughed at in public, and people giving me dirty looks and ignored, so I brace myself for the negative experiences in the future. As a result I come off cold, standoffish, reserved, and anxious. Even when I was feeling optimistic about something in my life, the joy quickly disappeared when someone started treating me like shit in public for “no reason” (when it’s just bc I’m ugly)\n\nConversely, attractive people I’ve noticed have always had people be open to talking to them and are more tolerable of anything they say. They welcome them with a smile, and ask about their life making them feel comfortable. This happens majority of the time so they expect people to respond positively to them in future interactions which makes them happy to engage and open up \n\nWhen your psychological need for love and belonging is met, it’s easy to be optimistic. When you’re made to feel isolated, rejected, and unwanted, obviously you’d feel dissatisfied', 'If you were more attractive it’s likely you would have a better “personality”. If people respected you and were attracted to you it would make you feel better about yourself. We gotta stop blaming ourselves for shit personalities unless we are blatant assholes because time and time again we’ve seen shitty attractive people be well liked and we’ve also tried ourselves to be outgoing and friendly just to still be treated like shit', 'agree 100% if your a billionaire and UGLY you still get respect, if your a great scientist and ugly you get respect, if your a great sportman and ugly you get respect, if your a great musician but ugly you get respect, but if your an ugly cleaner or cab driver or courier or waiter, you get treated like a loser and no one really respects you, they might be NICE to you as an act, but deep down they know your just a cab driver or just a waiter and you get treated like your at the bottom of society.', 'And the fact that he was a serial killer has nothing to do with anything?', 'Exactly. People only find personality attractive when they find the person physically attractive.', 'Right. But like with looks, some traits are more commonly ""good"" than others. Being temperate, assertive, confident, generous, etc.. Virtuous traits are valued by most people and the people who don\'t value them aren\'t people you generally want in your life anyway.

We'd assume that we're rebellious non-conformists who'd never fall victim to social control from authority figures. But the Milgram Experiment and it's many variations proves that to be wrong. The Asch Experiment, the Zimbardo Experiment, and many other psychological experiments prove that to be wrong.

Better to have loved and lost or never loved at all?,"As a 29 yo khv I often think about this.

I remember when she was sick, I drove 30 minutes to her place just to surprise her with some food I knew she would like because she had texted me saying she was feeling too weak to make herself something. This was very strange for me as I was never the caring type but seeing her smile made me happy in return. I was also much more motivated to exercise, do things around my apartment to make it look better (like buying new lamps as a few were broken but as there was enough light it never really bothered me to much) and so on\n\nI can safely say that I have noticed my own character changing for the better without her actively influencing it.

I mean, I haven\'t had any luck so far, but I can say that she really made me happy in the beginning and if it had worked out, my life would be a lot better than it is now.

It was better i guess, I didn’t see the asshole who insulted me and i mainly worked with people who left me alone. They did start small convos but that was it. They prob talk shit behind my back but that’s better then saying it to me. There’s some friendly people but they’re leaving and some do other jobs so i barely see them. 

 i may have to work with that asshole and other people i trained with soon but don’t want too. can’t complain to manager since it was my 3rd day. I did mess up a bit too. Sometimes i thought i cleaned a area but was wrong, i misheard people, i was kinda slow too. the manager also corrected me like 2 times and i messed up with checking out. I feel like i left a bad impression to many people. 

I talked shit to a coworker about the mean coworker and i thought we were by ourselves but apparently 2 other workers were there, now i’m worried they could tell the coworker or report me. One of them asked how was my first day and idk if they were tryna record me to see if i’ll say it again. But it seemed like a normal convo and they were acting normal. But i did mention how one of those workers didn’t do work but never said there name. ",[],https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1eqlsj4/yesterday_was_kinda_better_at_work/
Are middle school kids better than us?,"I remember how many of my classmates already had their first relationships in middle school. I assume it's the same nowadays.

Are they better than me?
I was exercising for years.
I was trying hard at school to be smart and get a good career.
I got a master's degree from one of the best universities in the country.
I have full time job that pays well.
I live alone independently, I cook and I keep my apartment clean.
I have a driver license and I drove to another country.
I speak foreign language fluently.
I have hobbies, I do sports.

Sure, I am not a rocket scientist, but on paper, I am capable person who achieved everything that is expected from average human, except for experiencing love.

Yet, there are middle schoolers who are in relationships, who laugh and kiss with their girlfriends while I rot alone in my apartment. 

Did they try harder than me? What did they do to deserve love? Where are their years of self-improvement? What is their secret?

It's simple, they were just born that way. They have the looks and personality so love comes natural to them.

Just think about it. Think about all the things that we achieved in life. How hard it was. And yet love is not obtainable to us. It's like some kind of a joke. When I was a kid I didn't even realize it was possible for adults to not experience love at all. I thought it was guaranteed.","[""Middle school kids get relationships and have dates.

It doesnt get better with age.,"I'm sorry but it doesnt. It's just a coping mechanism to say that and I think we all know it. I see this statement quite a bit on r/FA, and I think its selling people false hope.

 If you are a KHHV in your mid 20s with few friends or none, you're probably going to be that in your 30s and 40s. if you couldnt make friends in your youth at high school or university which are the most social times of your life, you wont do those things when you're older with much less opportunities. The ability to form friendships and relationships diminish greatly as you age. Few people want to make friends with someone in their 30s or 40s especially not an ugly socially awkward man.

Your parents will get old and die, few people will have the time and effort to make new friends past uni or their early work life. The few friends you have/had will fall away as they form relationships and have kids. 
Its brutal but dont just passively sit there thinking things will magically get better on themselves. 

If you're young(less that 25) do everything you can to get friends NOW, join hobby groups, college associations, just anything. Go to gym and gym max to see if that helps with getting a GF.

I'm 32, no friends, a KHV, a total loser, it's too late for me, it's not necessarily too late for you - but you have to be active.

But I always heard and saw on TV the whole “life gets better as you get older” dialog, and figured when I finally got out of school, my “loving good girl” trait would eventually pay off, and I’d find a guy that wanted to build a middle class, dedicated family like I also wanted, and be with me for the rest of my life.\n\nFast forward and in my mid-20’s,  I married a man that I didn’t like or was attracted to 100%.   It just felt so good to finally have a person that was committed and had the same desires of having a family - and I didn’t have to be alone anymore.  Fast forward 15 years and this asshole divorced me and married his mistress.  Later i found out that he left me because my antidepressants decreased our sex life.  🙄 He had already found a new “supply” and was basically like “fuck you” to me.  \n\nAfter my divorce, on one super depressing day, I realized that I’m back to being the **same lonely woman**  I was in high school!  I couldn’t believe it.  I was 34 at the tile, and no matter what, I couldn’t escape *my fate.*\n\nThe next long term relationship didn’t work out either.  I figured with this guy I’d give him more sex to make him happy, because at this point I learned that most guys are sexually charged and I didn’t want him to fall out of love and detach like my ex husband did.  Plus the intimacy was great between us.  Unfortunately, due to the whole “hate being alone” thing,  I ignored all the red flags, and he ended up ruining my life and career.  He also was a truck driver who i hardly ever saw,Naomi was still lonely even when I was *in* the relationship!   But i still held on because I still wanted that lifelong partner that he said he wanted to be.  Fast forward 5 Years later, and we’re off and on because he never contributied to us “growing.”  Also because his EXTREME mental issues came to light when I stopped being serious and let him know I was gonna date other people.  I told him i just wanted to be casual, and he agreed.  But once I started dating others, he butted up and  did anything, and i mean ANYTHING, to make sure I was all his in the end.  Even if it was manipulating and attacking the good aspects of  my life.  His demented “plans for success” traumatized me, and triggered my chronic depression.  As a result, all this ended up ruining my life and career.  So here I am, completely alone again and rock bottom 🥲\n\nI’m 40 now and still can’t believe I’m alone and broke.  By this age my folks were on their third house, and worked together to have a pretty comfortable living.  Both my siblings are either married or in a loving, committed, and long term relationship of 10+ years.  I go to family functions, and the only person I ever have as a plus one is my son.  He an awesome kid of course, but I only have him half time, so the “get togethers” often feel empty for me.\n\nI finally realized that the older you get, the harder it is to NOT be alone.  People are so damaged with social AND mental issues, and without proper therapy, these issues only get worse. So therefore you have all of these people running around with issues, causing havoc on good people that just want to have a loving, committed and STABLE relationship 🤷 \n\nDon’t get me wrong, I have issues too - i just don’t attack other people because of them.  \n\nI have super low self esteem and am codependent, so I pick horrible men that are attracted to me like fruit flies, because of my issues of vulnerability.  But I’m doing therapy and self help so I can conquer all this loneliness crap...\n\n...but I’m still old and alone.  I’ve had too many traumatic experiences trying to keep a man, and always end up attracting the ones that put me in therapy and give me PTSD.  So I’m currently working on accepting the fact that me being alone will be how it is, for the rest of my life. 🥲', 'I\'m 30 and while I\'ve had some brief flings (I wouldn\'t call them relationships) I still consider myself FA.  From my perspective, I\'d say it got kind of better with age, but not much.  When I was in college, I joined a fraternity, and took part in all kinds of social activities, and I STILL never found a girlfriend.  In all honesty, I wish I did more studying and less social activities during my college years.  And it\'s so true, most people my age are in long-term relationships and it\'s just so disheartening to be the person ""behind"" everyone in my age group.', '[removed]', ""My experience is kind of the reverse of most people.\n\nI'm 31. I was ok being FA up until I was about 27. I wouldn't say I was super happy but I had suppressed any desire to have a relationship fairly well up until then. I didn't see the point as my mental illness and crippling low self esteem and shyness made it impossible anyway. I wasn't exactly attractive either so it's not like I was turning down offers to achieve this FA status. It was just who I was and I was ok with it.\n\nThen I met someone at 27 who broke down all my barriers without even really trying and made me realise exactly what I had been suppressing for so long. He moved on and got a girlfriend and I'm here 4 years later still trying to deal with the weight of all these wants and feelings and emotions that I never even knew I had until recently. Now it feels too late to change. I have no idea what I'm doing anyway and the sheer obsessive neediness I felt over this guy was terrifying. We never even dated but even now he still feels like the one and only chance I ever had to be happy. I'm not even sure I'd want to feel that again anyway. Instead I'd like to get back to the obliviousness I lived in before.\n\nI don't want anyone else to feel this way. So if there are people younger than me who think they are ok with their FA status and have accepted it, great. However I would say to think really hard about if that is really what you want because it's much harder if you suddenly realise later on that you were lying to yourself.\n\nNow I'm 31 and when my parents die all I will have is my brother and a handful of friends. I have no job because I was on the verge of a breakdown due to depression so I had to quit. No direction, no purpose anymore. I just exist now."", ""I personally would love to get my hands on a KHHV.

I can promise you, any great opportunities that come your way will be missed if you project this type of thinking out into the universe. The message that your body language and demeanor radiates is **much** louder than spoken word.\n\nFriendships that stand the test of time are very hard to find and many people don't have them. There are, however, tons of opportunities for friendships born out of convenience or commonality. Sign up for cooking classes. Join a volleyball team. Volunteer. Join every social group associated with your hobbies. Doesn't matter if you like that shit. Just do it. You will definitely meet people there. Befriend everyone. Even if you don't like them.

And again, there's a reason I say at 25 years old it's over, the statistics show that only about 5% of men are still virgins at that age, that is a super minority of people who are deemed beyond dateable or fuckable in anyway, that would certainly affect a vast majority of people's self image or perception of themselves."", 'I know you are pretty set in your ways and I\'m not trying to change the way you think, but not all small change is meaningless.

We can\'t foresee the impact things have on us over time and how they change our futures forever. \n\nI guess it\'s based on your personal values, but just don\'t let what society thinks or values determine your life\'s value and what you should be valuing. I\'m 23 and I\'m a virgin, have never dated a girl or kissed a girl, but I personally know that that isn\'t what determines my worth. Yes it would be nice but I\'m not useless without having that experience and neither are you or anyone else. \n\nThe reason I say it\'s not over is because 25 is the beginning or your life. People seem to think it\'s the main part but life has barely started at that point so I dont think its reaosnbale for people to expect most 25 year olds to have it all figured out and to have a bunch of experience with girls by this stage. The expectations and standards that modern society holds makes it hard for majority of people to live up to them and thus makes them feel ""inferior"" or ""abnormal"" or whatever, which just doesn\'t make much sense. \n\nWe are all different and somehow we have let the opinions of entitled, superficial, and divisive figures determine how we should all be living our lives otherwise we are considered ""done for"". \n\nI can\'t tell you what to desire for yourself or what to value more, but all I can say is that there is always a chance life will turn around while you still have years to live on this earth and I hope some day you realize that you have more potential than you give yourself credit for.']",https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/wax7xs/nothing_depresses_me_more_than_knowing_literal/
"Never say ""It will get better.""","I really hate it when some delusional twats come here and the first comment/post they make is some contrived bullshit like ""It will get better.""

You have to understand that that saying things like that is just a flat-out lie and very belittling. Life is not a movie. Karma doesn't exist. Bad things happen to good people. No matter how hard you try, you can always fail miserably. There are many people in this sub who are a living proof of that. Saying things like that will just earn you hate.

Instead, if you really are hell-bent on spreading positivity on places like this. If you have some messiah complex. You should try saying something like ""It might get better as long as you don't give up.""

That statement is actually true. Even here. Sure it's pretty unlikely for some of us and it's not a guarantee, but it is possible. You might win the lottery no matter how unlikely that is. The only catch is that you can't give up. By giving up I mean hanging yourself. If you do that then yes, it won't get better. If you lock yourself in your room then also yes, it won't get better. It's OK to tell people to keep trying, but don't tell them that it guarantees success.

Why would they? The grass is as green as it can be on their side of the fence. \n\nAnd people don\'t just stay in unhealthy relationships to begin with, normally. If a relationship isn\'t working there\'s no reason to drag it out. You cherish the time spent together, agree to split and subsequently move on.

Not ideal. \n\nI\'ve seen so many poor souls do that for the sake of their kids. In that case the damage extends to them as well and they can tell both mommy and daddy aren\'t happy together.

Few will ever achieve it. I am cognoscent of that. Most will be lucky in other departments. Some will be smart, some will be healthy all their lives despite bad habits, some will be born to rich parents and others, well, probably won\'t be lucky at all, starting their lives as slaves with no freedoms, no money, and no healthcare and possible no loving parents or role models.\n\nWe should take the time to appreciate what we have, others have it so much worse, I feel.\n\n>So, what kind of questions did you ask them; like how they managed to get along so well?\n\nI asked them about how they did things together. They mentioned some interesting things. She loved reading, he didn\'t as much but enjoyed hearing her read so they did that. Depending on each others\' skills they would take turns with childcare, homework and such. They would split house chores based on dislikes. You got to do what you disliked doing the least. \n\nWhen one did the cooking the other did the dishes. One cleaned the bathroom, the other did the kitchen. It wasn\'t a rule or anything. They\'d both do the common area rooms and if needed they could switch chores or pick up the slack if one was sick in bed or something. \n\nThe word I would describe for them would be ""flexible"". Like I said I don\'t know how they reached this point, but they were both happy sharing random kisses every now and again and generally exhibiting a rather laid-back attitude. \n\nAnd you know the most amazing thing? Their speech was slightly different, same with the way they would respond to my questions. But somehow they melded to the point where I felt like if I was talking to one of them I could\'ve just as easily been talking to the other one. That was something that truly shocked me. It immediately hit me that should one of them perish the other person would quite frankly lose half of themselves. Made me think about all those pictures you see of broken hearts. I understood the significance of it right then and there.\n\nSorry for the long wall of text!', 'Yeah, when he says ""the gym"" he\'s talking about the MMA gym.

But as they say, no pain, no gain.\n\n>I'm not sure how to avoid this, since I have a feeling if I ever get into a relationship, it's going to be toxic :D \n\nThere is nothing that limits your from setting boundaries and communicating expectations with your future partner. Remember, it takes two to make a relationship work and flourish. This isn't to say there shouldn't be an **I** in *team*, as most people claim. Each person has needs, wants, desires, rules and so on. They should all be taken into account. I mean the whole idea of it is for both parties to benefit from the relationship. \n\nThe key to this is always communicating frankly with your partner and letting him know what is to be expected. He has to be open to doing the same. Trust will be difficult to establish otherwise and without it everything will fall apart.\n\n>That's how it goes when you have the self-esteem issues and the weak boundaries, you get the toxic relationships. \n\nThose would need to be addressed. I'm sorry if this sounds as f I'm being inconsiderate, it is not my intent but realistically you cannot allow another to take advantage of you, that's not a relationship. \n\nYou cannot achieve the happiness you seek by allowing others to chip away at your personality, using you for their benefit. Not only will it all end with you in a worse state than when you started but the other person may never learn either. They may end up thinking that what they experienced was normal and that it can be replicated in the next relationship. That would be very bad.\n\n>people will judge and say how could you, you need to find some other different kind of person\n\nI hope you don't harbor any ill will towards them, in their own way they are probably trying to help, thinking they could snap you out of it. Ironically this isn't very far from what I'm trying to do.\n\n>some people are made for toxic\n\nMaybe I'm incredibly naive but I don't buy it, not one bit. Nobody's supposed to suffer from the effects of a toxic relationship. Nobody should and I know not everyone can get out sometimes, things can get really complicated (marriage, kids, mortgage, etc). But again, I think people deserve better and nobody in my opinion should suffer like that.\n\n>Some people are bound for glory, some are bound for train wrecks and disaster.\n\nI don't know about you but I personally don't believe in fate, I prefer to forge my own path in life and deal with what may come my way. People who achieve glory can quite quickly come back down (hello darkness my old friend) and those that can't catch a break may at some point decide to change that, completely flip the paradigm on its head. As they say, the only constant in life is change. You never know what may come next.\n\nSo how about you go out there and make your own glory? You say self-esteem is an issue, then find the root cause of it. Be honest and write down all your fears, then start making plans on how to sort them out one by one, day by day. If you're committed to both finding a partner and being able to set stronger boundaries for when the time comes then my suggestion (and I say this with the utmost kindness) would be to get to work :D\n\n[Make your own path forward!](https://underthebluedoor.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/make-your-own-path.jpg?w=640)"", ""Please don't generalize.

The estimation to give a universal income that is actually livable would be 90-95%. "", "">  people in loving and happy relationships don't cheat.\n\n\n\nI wish that were true. The world would be a better place. \n\n\nI mean, not everybody cheats, some people don't cheat if they're in loving relationships. But, for some people, when you are with another person for a long time, and you have your ups and downs in the relationship, like normal happy relationships do, and your needs might not always be met 100% of the time, and sometimes you won't feel appreciated or listened to or cared for or respected, just because that's how relationships *are*. And then someone else comes along and wants you, and compliments you, and thinks you're amazing and you're incredible and you're the best thing since sliced bread, and it's kind of like crack for a person. Just having that kind of attraction and validation can make you feel like a whole new person, refreshed, renewed, ready to conquer the world. So, it's kind of hard to turn down when your life has become somewhat run-of-the-mill and complacent, and most days are just filled with all the drudgery of getting through day-to-day life. \n\n\nThis actually happened to someone in my family recently. They had been together for 15 years, happily married, and sure, they did have some conflicts and problems, like with things like house cleaning, as you mentioned in your post. And the husband cheated with a female friend of his who was in love with him. And his wife found out, and the husband was just devastated. Like, he still loved his wife dearly, he wanted to be with her, they were each other's first love, and he didn't want to be with the other woman, it was just an unfortunate case of giving in to temptation. The temptation was too strong, he made a mistake. And he felt like he ruined both of their lives now, just for this temporary loss of self-control. \n\n\nSo, sometimes, it happens. You can still love each other, and have a relatively happy marriage, but you make a mistake, you succumb to certain difficult to control desires. \n\n\nThanks for your answer about this couple's marriage, though. I like hearing about it. This is like awwwww:\n\n\n> they were both happy sharing random kisses every now and again"", 'Yes, I understand what you\'re saying, and I know that it\'s all correct. You are right in all that you say. I just think that sometimes for certain people who have had a hard life socially, and who have endured a lot of rejection, who perhaps didn\'t have much in the way of friendships, never really had a good friend, if someone were to come along and show them the kindness and attention that they\'ve never had but always longed for, then the ability for said person number one to act completely rationally, or healthily in a relationship is not particularly strong, and probably is a bit out of their reach. Like, it hasn\'t ever been developed, and the person might not have the emotional resources for it. \n\n\nFor instance, recently, after being friendless and relationship-less for over 25 years, I started trying to meet a significant other. I met someone who didn\'t live near me, and we had a long-distance relationship. Well, we had a very strong connection, emotionally, mentally, sense-of-humor-wise, etc. And the first time we talked on the phone, I tell him that I have depression, and he tells me that it\'s okay, he doesn\'t mind listening to people when they\'re upset, it doesn\'t bother him when people cry, and that I can talk to him about anything, any problems, etc. He says, in fact, that I can talk to him *anytime*. If I am depressed, he will make the time to talk to me. Whenever I am sad, just talk to him.\n\n\nWell, this was like the sweetest manna that my soul had ever felt. It was like some beautiful mercy raining down on me from above and filling all the damaged parts of me with sweetness and light. No one had ever said that to me, and I had never had a  friend of any kind like that who would be willing to talk to me when I was upset, other than my family. I have had friends before, but it was usually more about me being giving to them than vice versa. \n\n\nAnyways, this fact of someone filling a very huge need that I have in life can make up for a lot of ugliness in other ways in a relationship. This guy ended up not following through on what he proposed; he admitted to me that he had borderline personality disorder and was a narcissist and compulsive liar, but it took me awhile to realize these things about him, and I gave him a lot of chances and the benefit of the doubt because it was the only time I had had what felt like a ""true"" relationship to me, where someone was actually there for me. \n\n\nBut, on the other hand, I did end it after awhile once I realized that he wasn\'t being honest with me. He told me beautiful things, but his actions didn\'t match it. And, of course, I like to think that I would never be in a relationship with someone who was abusive or overly controlling or something. But, honestly, I\'m not sure. I think that we here who have been ""losers"" socially, are particularly susceptible to finding ourselves in that kind of relationship, unfortunately :/\n\n\n\n>Maybe I\'m incredibly naive but I don\'t buy it, not one bit.

Love is when you never in a million years would dare harm the one person you care about the most in the world. \n\nLove is the thing you see when a partner is taking care of their sick counterpart. Love is when he does the dishes or cooks the meals because he knows you have more important things to worry about for the next couple of days or week or whatever. Love is when you both are exhausted but decide to keep to your goals and exercise together. It\'s the last batch of chocolate or whatever food item you prefer that\'s always left in the fridge because of how one of you always wants the last nibble. Love is made up of the little things.\n\nLove is also there when you both get wrinkly skin and grey hair and you both couldn\'t care any less about it because you already can see beyond the imperfections. You can see straight to the core. Love is when you can finish each other\'s sentences and can make fun of it because you\'ve known each other for so long.\n\nWorth giving all that up for lust? Never, not in my world anyway.\n\nI am sorry to hear of what happened with your family member. Rarely is house cleaning the issue, more frequently it\'s the nagging that goes along with it, lol. \n\n>Like, he still loved his wife dearly, he wanted to be with her, they were each other\'s first love, and he didn\'t want to be with the other woman\n\nBut...he just had sex with that other woman. Like this doesn\'t compute at all. You didn\'t mention anything about an open marriage so I\'m assuming this is just straight up cheating, both emotional and physical. I get what you mean in a sense but think about what he had to rationally give up for the sex he had.\n\nHe would be ruining his female friend\'s life. When word would get out she would be seen in a not so positive light. \n\nHe would be breaking his wife\'s heart, the woman he chose to love and care for in both good times and in bad. The person he shared 15 years of his life with, entire memories now stained because of 1 move. The trust he had built, all gone in an instant. The life he built with her, it would come crashing down. And for the love of Mother Nature, their kids, you never mentioned any but if there were, they would be collateral damage, caught in the possible subsequent divorce. Having to decide between two parents possibly. Just horrific.\n\n>So, it\'s kind of hard to turn down\n\nQuite the opposite, why would someone just decide to do so much damage for lust? Because they were bored? Well that\'s one heck of an expensive solution for their boredom I must say!\n\nAs I always keep telling people. If you\'re in a relationship, be honest and communicate. I mean problem solve together not argue or shout, that doesn\'t lead anywhere. If you go to r/deadbedrooms you will see a lot of people\'s stories there and how they struggle when their love language (physical touch in their case) isn\'t being fulfilled. You\'ll read plenty of stories from people who say that everything is perfect in their relationship except the sex (and not just, in some cases it\'s hugs and cuddles too), which is usually non-existent or close to. So in a way I can totally empathize. \n\nBut then again if you look at their posts do you know who they always bring up? Their SO. Always. Never anyone else. They\'re not interested in being loved by anyone else. They want their partner, not someone new for the night. It\'s not the sex, they crave the affection that comes with it, something that their partner cannot or does not wish to (most often the case) reciprocate. \n\nFew people speak of cheating there. Most are desperately trying other strategies like counseling, self-improvement, fulfilling their partner\'s love language and so on. Like I said they want their partner because that\'s ultimately who they love and wish to share the love with. \n\n>So, sometimes, it happens. You can still love each other, and have a relatively happy marriage, but you make a mistake, you succumb to certain difficult to control desires.\n\nThat\'s not just one mistake, he sought after and approved of the cheating. That takes time, hence multiple mistakes that he consented to, it\'s not like tripping and falling into a lake: [*oops*](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Man-Falls-Trying-to-Push-Dog.gif)\n\n>This is like awwwww:\n\nThought so too which is why I mentioned it. Though they tended to hide their affection at times from prying eyes. Almost like they were shy about it or something. Luckily their affection oftentimes would override their shyness. It was adorable to watch. What most people on the internet would call ""relationship goals"". \n\nThis turned out to be a rather long response but I felt like it had to be. Relationships are hard and they\'re hard for good reasons. That is why they are so rewarding when they are successful and why we celebrate them so much. A difficult but noble pursuit, to be sure.\n\nEdit: typos', '> Like, it hasn\'t ever been developed, and the person might not have the emotional resources for it.\n\nYou\'ve summed it up quite nicely there. You are absolutely correct in your assessment, it would be quite difficult to know what ""normal"" feels like and how one should navigate the maze that sometimes can be a relationships if they\'ve not had much experience beforehand. \n\nLuckily this can be helped. You mentioned friends. A lot of people mention them here. Some have even pointed out that a wide social circle isn\'t what they\'re really after, that they would rather just have a partner. Well the truth of the matter is that friends can help a great deal with emotional development. \n\nThey can be invaluable as they\'re the ones that teach you early on what a proper working friendship looks like. They teach you what works and what doesn\'t and a lot of the times you may even end up learning a lot about yourself in the process of interacting with them. That is why sometimes you\'ll hear people say that they\'re in a relationship with someone who is both their partner and their ""best friend"". What they mean by that is that they\'ve found a person they know is good for them, easily makes them feel welcome and whom they can communicate with naturally. It can be hard to navigate if you\'ve not had very good friends in your life. How may one build a house without a [strong foundation]( http://www.gcar.net/images/uploads/news/bigstock-Helping-One-Another-72025723.jpg)? - comes to mind\n\nThis is why I can understand your point of view and I\'m sorry you\'ve not had the good fortune of a proper friendship. Trust me when I say that you\'ll know them when you find them. For my best friend in particular I didn\'t lol (ya, alright, maybe you won\'t always know right away). But darn it if he wasn\'t insistent at the time and a good thing too, it was just the push that I needed to see how amazing of a person he was. I kid you not when I say that I wouldn\'t be the person I am without a lot of the things he taught me early on. I am always grateful to such people. They make the world a better place and they\'re rarely appreciated enough for it. \n\nHaving said all that, FAers are correct when they say that friends will never fill the void of loneliness. Well, partially correct, it can help, but it doesn\'t compare to having  partner you can share your life with. \n\n>Well, this was like the sweetest manna that my soul had ever felt.\n\nI think so many people here can understand quite profoundly what that feeling is like. Some, if not most, will even experience it at one point. Whether it lasts is another matter though, that is why I say that you need to be ready to not just form a relationship but to fight to make it the best you can and sometimes that requires a lot of diplomacy, problem solving and self-discipline. Plus a lot of flexibility and understanding from the other partner, of course\n\n>I have had friends before, but it was usually more about me being giving to them than vice versa.\n\nThat\'s not what I would describe as a true friend but then that may also be why I have so very few and a lot of others I consider close acquaintances. It might sound harsh but I like making that distinction. I feel it is important.\n\n>Anyways, this fact of someone filling a very huge need that I have in life can make up for a lot of ugliness in other ways in a relationship\n\nAnd that is sadly why toxic relationships occur. People are willing to put up with quite a lot just for that. When it\'s the first time someone\'s shown you love and compassion, you have a tendency to cling on to it for dear life, fearing it may never happen to you again based on previous personal data you\'ve accumulated. Much like scientific experiments, if you\'ve done it once, it can be replicated!\n\n>This guy ended up not following through on what he proposed\n\nI think we\'ve all seen this in works of fiction as well as in real life. It becomes less surprising after awhile but not less difficult to watch. You just can\'t help but feel for the person going through it because most often they simply wanted to love and be loved back. And as usual someone always comes along to take advantage of the situation. It is incredibly unfair.\n\n>I gave him a lot of chances and the benefit of the doubt because it was the only time I had had what felt like a ""true"" relationship to me, where someone was actually there for me.\n\nYou tried, don\'t beat yourself up over it, **ever**. Learn from the experience and use that knowledge for the next person that you wish to allow to be part of your life. Over the years I\'ve interacted with quite a few people. Regardless of my views of them and their views of me, a lot of the times I\'d learn something new from them. Either that or they would help me put the puzzle pieces (information) together in a way that would make sense. For example, awhile back I didn\'t really know much about narcissism. Until someone told me how such people always talk about *themselves*, complain about *their* life. How they use emotional blackmail to get what *they* want. All of that not-wonderful-at-all stuff. It made me realize that I already knew of someone like that in my life. But until then I had not been able to piece two and two together. \n\n>But, on the other hand, I did end it after awhile once I realized that he wasn\'t being honest with me. He told me beautiful things, but his actions didn\'t match it.\n\nI always say this but in a relationship time is the great revealer. People can\'t hide their true selves forever, which is why playing games and pretending you\'re someone you\'re actually not during the dating phase doesn\'t work. It just leads to a relationship that will fail sooner or later, ending up with both parties being hurt as a result. And if it goes too far you have to deal with maybe a divorce and kids which is exponentially more complicated.\n\n>And, of course, I like to think that I would never be in a relationship with someone who was abusive or overly controlling or something. But, honestly, I\'m not sure.\n\nI have no business saying this but I personally think you wouldn\'t be. You may be a loving person but you\'re also sensible. Just like with your previous relationship you\'d be able to see the warning signs and act accordingly, despite the emotional difficulty involved. Believe in yourself!\n\n\n>Anyways, I do agree with you about this. I was being a little dramatic, I suppose with the ""some people are made for toxic."" I know that\'s not really true.\n\nNo worries, I understood that but I felt the need to share my viewpoint. Sometimes our subjectivity colours our perceptions unfairly due to how we\'ve experienced life. I imagine you know how that goes.\n\n>I like your little image, it\'s inspirational!\n\nA picture sometimes is worth a 1000 words. Though it wouldn\'t be so bad if it were accompanied by a bit of text too I suppose xD\n\nEdit: typos', 'Okay, thank you.

', ""Lol, I've never done crack either, so maybe it wasn't the best example, but, actually I CAN imagine how addictive and overpowering it would be. \n\n\nSo, I guess you will just have to take my word for it, but I can assure you that this family member's relationship that I speak of was everything you write about here:\n\n\n>Love is the thing you see when a partner is taking care of their sick counterpart. Love is when he does the dishes or cooks the meals because he knows you have more important things to worry about for the next couple of days or week or whatever. Love is when you both are exhausted but decide to keep to your goals and exercise together. It's the last batch of chocolate or whatever food item you prefer that's always left in the fridge because of how one of you always wants the last nibble. Love is made up of the little things.\n\n\n\n The husband did all this for the wife, and he, in fact, did (and still does) love her dearly. I know because I have been able to observe their relationship quite closely. \n\n\n\nOkay, everything else that you say about cheating, I agree completely, and I don't have any tolerance for it either. It's refreshing to read how much clarity you have as far as your ethical stance on the matter. I am similar. I think cheating is hugely disrespectful to your partner, and if you're not happy together, you either talk it out/do counseling or go your separate ways. \n\n\nAnd when I say that it was a mistake on his part, what you say about mistakes is true. I just used the word mistake to say that it was something that the person regrets they did. I mean, clearly, it's bad behavior. And clearly, it was a bad decision, a horrible decision, that I have a feeling will haunt the guy for the rest of his life. Also, this couple did realize after this happened that they had some degree of unresolved communication issues. Anyways, I'm not arguing that cheating is okay or that it's not a big deal or trying to justify it in any way. I mostly am just trying to refute your point that it means automatically that you don't love the person that you're with. Sometimes, you still do. \n\n\nTo bring the topic back to drugs again, lol, it's sort of similar to situations where, let's say a husband or a father is addicted to drugs. Now, let's say he truly deeply loves his family, and also, he knows that doing drugs is hurting his family, yet he still might continue to do drugs because it is the only thing that will soothe the pain that he is feeling at the moment. It's not something that he's doing that actively hurts anyone else, and, in his mind, I'm sure he's thinking of it as something that is unrelated to anyone else, but is what he needs to do for himself, to make life bearable and to survive in this cold, hard place we find ourselves in. I don't think it's right to say that the man doesn't love his family, or that it is impossible to still love his family. Sometimes you hurt the people that you love. You still love them, though. Really. Love is not perfect.  \n\n\nAnyways, on a lighter note, that's one of the best gifs I've ever seen by the way, it's so perfect, it made my night :)"", ""The problem is that some of us here haven't been able to get friends, either, hence the dilemma.

Everyone is always better than me,"As someone who is considered an observer of life since I'm apparently not good enough to participate in any meaningful life experiences.. I notice everyone is better than me, without much effort. Everyone else looks better than me, has a better personality, they're smarter, they have more money, they're more socially graceful and accepted, they have HELLA FRIENDS AND FAMILY that love and support them through just about anything,,, while I have no one. I often want to blame myself but I've tried. I've tried being an outgoing, bubbly, self assured, interesting person... and it got me nowhere. Which is why outside of being ugly, I assume I'm autistic, because aint no way someone can try for this many years and still wind up alone.. even in the platonically. I look at everyone and they smile, they joke, they tease each other like they've known each other for YEARSSS and I've never been able to do that without the fear of wondering if I said something offensive, boring, stupid, or whatever else. From what I can see no one else has these worries, they just blurt out whatever is on their mind and people roll with it and add something to match. I notice when people find someone attractive they just dive right into flirting with them and surprisingly the other person is open and entertains it... whenever I've done that I've either been laughed at, or looked at like the very thought that I ever had a chance with them offended them for a lifetime and they dismiss me. I've exercised, I've got a fit body, I've bought nice clothes, got a haircut, have decent hygiene and I'm STILL UGLY and undesirable. I've tried being outgoing, friendly, funny, personable, and everything and it still was never enough to even make as little as a friend, let alone a partner. I'm to point I don't even want a partner anymore I Just want friends, but I'm apparently not even good  enough for that with how ugly and mentally fucked up I am.

With a good profile I get maybe one match a day on Tinder, and every other day on other dating apps. People usually ghost me in 2 messages or right after asking them out, it really fucks with my mental health.\n\nI'm hopeful that right now it's a matter of time until I find a SO but I hope it's soon because I feel really lonely."", 'the usual false hope, so worse because now my length of time single is even more of a red flag', ""Meh, to be determined.\n\nFor reference, the best outcome for my situation is that I lose all attraction to people and become fully content with lifelong loneliness. I know the first is probably pretty unlikely, but the second is something I'm actually hoping for, and I'm thinking it'd even make attraction easier to deal with.\n\nSo in the beginning of the year, I had hope, which was not a good thing. The people I was around gave it to me, and I'd developed an interest in someone that I actually thought could become something. I predictably ended up spiraling, which left a mark that's lasted to this day, and you'd think that'd dissuade me for a bit at least, but nope. I still had a general hope, which produced a couple pointless summer job attractions, and then it culminated as a strong attraction in a summer class. After temporarily spiraling in that one too, I made a move for the first time ever, and was predictably rejected. The fallout taught me a little bit and ended up souring my hope, but the attraction annoyingly persisted and developed for the first person again (the one from the beginning of the year). I fought it all semester by reclusing myself from her, and that seemed to keep it at bay, but then, just after the semester ended, I made the dumbest decision of the year and become involved in an event with her that happens early this year. This strongly renewed my fool's hope, and after it burned uncontrollably for several days, I've started tamping it down again. But something damaging is bound to happen at that event, and time will only tell the ultimate outcome of that. Best case scenario is it's damaging enough to permanently destroy my hope but not damaging enough to destroy me as a person, and the worse case is, well, it turns out to be too damaging. Guess I'll find out what happens in a couple weeks, I'm hoping for a blessing in disguise but history tells me not to expect anything positive.\n\nI'm sure nobody will read this, but it was nice to get it out there somewhere because I can't tell anyone in my actual life (lest they think I'm crazy, pitiful, or likely both).

There is always someone better than me,"Every time I’m out at work or in public and see a guy my age or younger hanging out with his friends, his girlfriend, or multiple girls, I instantly know and say to myself “Damn, that guy is *so* much better than me and I absolutely suck compared to him”. Just from that alone, I know that he is better than me in almost every single way possible, that he has social status, that he has people  who aren’t family who like him, and that his life is far more valuable and exciting than mine. He is like an expensive high class steak dinner with champagne, and I’m beef jerky. I’m so utterly jealous of that guy, but I have no resentment towards them because they have far more than I do just by being themselves.

Conventionally attractive, neurotypical, normally socialized and well adjusted guys will *always* have an advantage over me, have *far* more potential than me and be *infinitely* more desirable than me. No amount of self improvement or late socializing can ever truly compare to a normal guy who’s built himself up naturally socially and romantically. I can try my absolute hardest to learn all of the social skill “party tricks” that are required to get people to like you (because who you are simply isn’t good enough and you need to be someone you aren’t) even if it literally brings me to the point of exhaustion, and then some normal attractive guy with more charisma in his big toe than I have in my whole body can, just by being himself, almost immediately charm anyone I meet away. This world and people are fundamentally against autistic and neurodivergent people, there is absolutely no place or patience for us and we are nothing but worms compared to the average neurotypical guy.

What’s even worse is that anything I can possibly achieve will be absolutely nothing compared to them. I finally by stroke of divine luck manage to get my first kiss and relationship? Big whoop, most guys have been getting that stuff since they were teens and continue to do so. I spend painful years of my life desperately trying to learn how to socialize and talk with normal people? That’s nothing, most people learned how to do that shit since they started school and have natural social skills that completely blow that out of the water. I manage to finally experience my first sexual encounter? Whatever, most people have plenty of experience at this point and your total lack of experience or knowledge will inevitably lead to a miserable and awkward experience that your partner will show absolutely no sympathy or understanding for, wondering why they wasted their time with you when they could have found someone actually experienced. I finally manage to get even mildly competent at a hobby I’m passionate about. Pff, most people have been doing socially acceptable hobbies since they were young and are infinitely more talented at many things than I am at anything. Hell, I know for a fact that there are some number of people I went to school with that will get lucky and become famous big hits, nothing I do could ever possibly match them.

**Right now as I’m writing this, guys I went to school with along with an innumerable amount of guys my age are living their lives experiencing all the friends, romance, sex and fun they can get their hands on just by being themselves. They’ve never once in their life had to pick up a self help book or go on a lifelong journey of reinvention to get those things, it just came to them.

Being bitter and standoffish is better than being a clown,"What I am about to say applies to both foreveralone men and foreveralone women. When you are physically unattractive, you think that being kind and funny will make you attractive. Wrong. Being a kind person won't attract a sexual partner. I am guilty of that. I am a foreveralone woman with a facial deformity. No amount of sense of humor, kindness will make men GENUINELY attracted to me (the key word here is GENUINELY). 

The problem is that a lot of unattractive people end up becoming clowns. They make people laugh. I have made that mistake myself. Terrible. Who wants to be the clown of the classroom? Just because I can make a man laugh, it doesn't mean he is GENUINELY attracted to me (again, the key word here is GENUINELY). 

Wrong, wrong, wrong. I think an unattractive person who is kinda bitter and standoffish is much better than an unattractive person who tries to make people laugh. It's pathetic. I witness this phenomenon so many times. I see unattractive people making self-deprecating jokes to make people laugh, in the hopes they will be less lonely.

What’s it like to have a sibling who looks better and is and more successful than you?,"I have a younger brother, he is 17…

He is everything I wanted to be but was unable to due to factors out of my control (i.e. I was “lucky” enough to pull basically every bad genetic trait from my parents.)

My family adores him, they do stuff for him they would never do for me (like giving him a credit card, giving him an expensive phone, etc…) 


I don’t hang out with him because I know I’ll be invisible near him. (And I am sure he does not want to be seen near me too.)


I am 180cm tall and weigh 67Kg
He is 193cm tall and weighs 76Kg…

He is stronger and healthier than me…
Is socially more successful than I have ever been and had more dates than I can ever hope to have.


He gets invited to social stuff…

Meanwhile my parents care less and less about me… they don’t even care about the fact that I spend most of my time locked inside my room using the computer. 
They used to ask me to go out and do stuff for them. No more. They are just letting me rot alone in my room.

They treat me like some sort of slave while he can sleep however much he wants… among other things.

Though I am happy because he won’t have the same fate I did… I am very jealous and somewhat resentful.  Why did I have to be the ugly duck?! 

Women compliment his appearance… among other things.


In other words: I am the ugly, recluse, socially anxious/awkward and probably autistic sibling.

"36m, I don’t feel like my life is ever going to get better, so why stick around?","I was always kind of a hopeless romantic, but I guess I always felt like something *could* happen. I no longer feel that way anymore.

The last three years of my life have crushed me. I lost my job (and have t found stable work since, just got laid off again two months ago and still looking), I lost my apartment and everything I’d ever worked for, I’ve been forced to bounce between living with my dad and living with my friends who are married. I’ve put on an ungodly amount of weight, and perhaps it is paranoia, but I feel like my hairline is thinning as well.

But I’ve always been good with enduring pain. My family was pretty emotionally abusive to me growing up. My dad blame my parents’ divorce on me, my sister told me to kill myself, and just last year before having to move in with friends, my mom said she was ashamed of me and didn’t know how my pride would let me be a burden in someone else. Good stuff.

But the thing that is truly killing me is this loneliness.

For my entire life, all I’ve wanted is to have a girlfriend. Everyone else makes it seem to easy. I remember being a kid, and my friend who lives down the street I always thought was even more nerdy than I was, and I remember vividly one day hanging out (we must have been around 12-13), him just nonchalantly mentioning having a girlfriend at school (he was a year above me, so different schools). I think that was the first time I remember feeling this way, like “I actually don’t understand how people become girlfriends and boyfriends”. We moved around a lot, so I never had a good friend until much later in life. In high school, I was “friends” with a kid who constantly belittled me and made fun of me to his other friends; I guess I was so desperate, that all just seemed “normal”.

When my parents split up, I dropped out of school and starting working full time, I got my GED a year early. I tried taking college classes, but I was just never really passionate about anything. Honestly, all I really cared about was making decent enough money to support a family, whenever I met someone. Since college is expensive, and we were fairly poor back then, I wound up just taking a few odd remedial courses, and then never finishing my degree. (so many job applications ask if you ever attended college, not if you *completed* a degree, I’ve wound up sort of embracing a lie that I got my bachelors — despite only having taken like two classes, and I’m pretty sure they’re not even college credits now).

I feel like I just don’t “get it”. It almost feels like the ENTIRE rest of the world has this private joke, and I’m just not in on it.

I don’t know how to get a girl to go out on a date. How to get a girl to come over and watch a movie or tv show. How to get a girl to play a game. And I certainly don’t know how to get a woman to want to have sex with me. Or hold hands, or kiss.

I’m 36 fucking years old, and I’ve never been kissed. When I was 30, I was so insanely lonely that I wound up paying for an escort. It was incredibly awkward, and while I felt a bit better at the time, I’ve still never been able to get a woman out on a date, or to do anything.

I’ve always been heavy set and overweight, but since getting laid off, I’ve ballooned up to 350 lbs. I actually was a smidge over. I started dieting again, came down just under, but I’m still just hovering at like the exact same weight. I feel fucking miserable, and I’m not seeing any progress, and I want to just give up.

And really, I think that’s just sort of it; I feel like I’m ready to just give up. I’m 36 years old and I’ve never had a girlfriend, never been kissed, I can’t even find a stable job, and I’m so overweight, it’s unlikely I will ever look “normal”. My whole life, I have always felt so alone and unloved like there is something wrong with me, and at this point, I don’t feel like that is ever going to change.

A few weeks ago, I joined my friends to church (I’m not religious, but they are, and thought it might do some good or something), and all I could think about was seeing these young attractive people (probably all high schoolers), and how I wished I was them. They all just seemed so happy, and you could just tell, they would never know what it’s like to feel how I feel. I was jealous of them, happy for them because they would probably never know these horrible sorts of feelings that someone like me has… but also just very sad, knowing that I’ll never know what that’s like. I’ll never know what it’s like to just *be* happy, and feel like the future is full of limitless possibilities.

I hate everything about myself. I hate my appearance, far more than anything else, but I also just don’t like the person that I am. I feel so broken, I don’t think I will ever be able to see the world through anything other than through this lens of sadness and despair. If I magically woke up tomorrow with the physique of my dreams, or suddenly became a billionaire… I don’t think anything would even really change. Because the *person* that I am has been ruined. I don’t think I’m ever going to get better, and I’m never going to be happy, and I’m never going to meet someone that truly loves me.

Right now, “living” just feels like I’m gasping for air and finding just enough to prolong my suffering. Every week, especially on friday nights, I just feel the weight of how fucking desperately lonely I really am. If this is all my life if ever going to be, I would rather just shoot myself so I don’t have to continue experiencing this torment.","['I actually have read this and it just feels relatable even if i am a bit younger.

"Being divorced is not ""better"" than being FA","I hear this all the time from people...

""Consider yourself lucky you are not in a relationship or marriage"" because half of marriages end up in divorce. ""Trust me, you don't need a relationship to be happy. You don't need marriage"" ect. 

I was just reading a statistic that for Americans at least, 80% of those who get divorced end up remarrying. 60% of widows remarry within a decade. 

And... the divorce rate for second marriages (*with same partner) is 23% which is significantly less. 6-10% even end up remarrying the same person. 

There are many women who don't care that you had a previous marriage...

In fact, in many cases it shows experience. If you have no problems finding someone who is willing to marry you, chances are it won't be hard finding someone else again. 

Not to mention, even if I never got remarried again, I still got to live a life where I experienced love and intimacy (big deal!)

On the other hand, you tell most anyone that you've never dated or had your first kiss reaching your 30s, and you might as well be a serial killer.

Better that I am not in a relationship,"Another thought that came to me right now is that it probably is better that I am not in a relationship anyways.

Afterall, I literally have no drive and no motivation to do anything. I mostly just do things because I have to but it takes so much energy if there is no drive and no motivation.

Any women who would choose me would simply be miserable. Therefore it is probably for the best that I never was in a relationship and most likely never will be in a relationship as well. ""Most likely"" because we cannot know the future. 

Of course, another argument might be that I am exactly like this because of no relationship. There is truth to it that a relationship or the (strong) hope for it does give motivation, drive and energy to overcome the struggles one is facing, but I think that boat has sailed a couple months to years ago in my case.

Right now, I don't feel much anymore when I try to imagine a woman by my side. Of course it is just an imagination and not the real deal. Though, the realization that not even the thought of it stimulates me much anymore worries me that the real deal also will not stimulate me anymore in anyways. I fear that I'll still feel empty even if I get into a relationship at this point. This was different a couple months to years ago.

The strangest thing is, even realizing this and rationally explaining it to myself, I still crave a relationship, well knowing that it most likely will end miserable for her. It is very strange. This inherent drive most of us have for a relationship is very strange indeed.

I wish had the same drive to work out, improve myself, finish my studies, study my religion, strengthen my faith, be productive in general, produce helpful content for others and many more.","['Yeah realistically I have too many mental issues to be ""relationship material"".

Ever feel like the world is better off without you?,"Not in a suicidal way (though I won't rule this out). But in an isolated way. 

Let me explain.

If you were in a relationship before, seeing your ex happier with someone else now.

You get rejected, then seeing your crush happier with another person.

Your friends ditched you, and they are happier with another group of friends.

Your best friend abandoned you, because they are happier in a relationship.

People ignoring your calls or messages, yet they are active on social media responding to other people.

People won't hang out with you, but have no problems meeting up with other people.

You get the point...

What is up with this isolation? Why do people seem to be happier when they are NOT with me? I feel like such a burden. Am I not cool enough? Not rich enough? Not good looking enough. And it snowballs too. Just be positive, they say. No, this been going on for decades and I don't know how to stay positive about it.

think it’s better i go to my families country in future ,"

If i still end up alone after uni or my 30s maybe earlier, i think i’ll just leave USA. Idk if it’s a good idea cuz i heard the economy in my families country is bad but it don’t matter at this point. I dreamt my future wanting to make games but i think it’s not gonna be successful. 

Most games are only popular if they’re super good and well known. I really wanna do it but i think even if i end up doing it, it’ll just be a flop and only one game would be made. anyways i feel more alone in the usa. All i have is my mom and dad. 

My dad has to leave usa soon for personal reasons so it just leaves me, mom and stepdad. My mom has some family here but they’re not super close with us and my dad has only like 3 family members in usa but they’re in another state. In my families country i got grandparents,uncles/aunts, cousins etc. 

 i think i’ll feel less alone being there. My mom said they won’t even be there for me all day and i told her it’s better then being here alone with just my mom and her husband who isn’t blood related to me. I think some of my family members may not like me but i don’t even care. I can’t bare this loneliness forever. I wish my mom & dad never chose to live in usa and have me here.

How I came to the realisation of why some autistics are treated so well and perform better at life than other autistics,"It's literally just coz they are more conventionally attractive. Thats it. People perceive their social deficiencies as positive character traits such as ""cool, funny, passionate, strong personality"" in comparison to a less fortunate autistic who will be perceived as ""ugly, weird, creepy, childish"" since they have nothing to show for the lack of social skills. 

If you want to survive in society and have friends, employment and romantic connections, you need to at the bare minimum be either neurotypical and/or conventionally attractive, otherwise its just far too difficult to survive. 

If you're ugly/average but neurotypical you can compensate with social skills in order to have friends and a job. And then with enough self improvement you should be able to form at least a few romantic connections in your life. I feel like most people in the world fit into this category. 

I will note however that being attractive will not immediately remove the negative impacts of autism on your life. You will still struggle immensely with employment, friendships and romantic connections. However, what im trying to get at is that if you are an autistic that is attractive, the chances of all your hard work and self improvement paying off to the point where you are able to have friends, employment and romantic relationships is much much much higher than for an ugly autistic since your looks can kinda makeup for your social deficiencies. 

It really makes me sad how not only am I autistic I also am balding, indian, 5'5 and been told I have a 'pedo**' face** by a literal university age girl. So now I have no defining qualities that can allow me to achieve my dreams in just living a normal life. ","['I think the autism spectrum is too wide a range of possible traits to be making these kinds of judgments.\n\nJust the word ""autism"" doesn\'t even come close to being able to describe any particular individual\'s collective behaviors such that we can know what social faux pas they may or may not commit that would put other people off.\n\nAnd to address a broader topic not just limited to FA, that\'s why I think ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" is kind of a useless diagnosis.', 'That might be the case but I feel it’s more nuanced in that while having autism or being neurodivergent (as there are other neurodivergent conditions), can make life challenging in terms of friendships, relationships, employment, etc. being attractive may be one factor but if you have other mental health conditions on top of autism it can make it difficult to just connect or relate with others. Being attractive helps to get attention but your personality and traits also matter and in relationships people can pick up on the quirks and differences of autistic people. Neurotypical people can be average looking but they generally don’t have the struggles that autistic people face so your right in that they can compensate with social skills to get a job and have friends which is kind of a baseline to have for relationships. It’s certainly complicated and other factors you’ve mentioned being Indian for one, I’m also South Asian and have an older brother who is struggling in dating and he says the negative stereotypes people have make it hard to overcome. It’s sad but maybe other neurodivergent people can try to find other people with similar traits or interests and see if that helps to build a connection.', 'Thanks for acknowledging that autism is indeed, a spectrum.

You can\'t blame these disadvantaged families for not being able to see or know how to deal with FA signs when they have no way to have learned about it and they already have issues to deal with. \n\nYour rebuttal only applies to the rich and middle class who have the money, leisure, and resources to help socialize their kids. They have money and have significantly less problems to worry about than lower-class families, which gives them the luxury to socialize their kids. They\'re are the outliers here, I\'m talking about average and lower-class families, who don\'t have any of those leisures, and a lot of problems to deal with already, so we don\'t get that same support from our parents to socialize. I come from a low-income black community; the common consensus was you develop socially by making friends with the neighborhood kids, growing up playing basketball all the time, going to the park,  make friends and fit in at school, etc. We don\'t get any of these enrichment activities, and we\'re lucky if we manage to get any extracurricular opportunities at all. \n\nOf course, there are cases where it is obviously their fault, like when they don\'t catch onto signs of bullying, they shelter their kids, they don\'t let them socialize or make friends, etc. However, just because you\'re FA, doesn\'t mean  ""your parents failed"" because there are various reasons why you could be FA. It could be because of the earlier reasons I gave (your parents proactively denied you social development), you might end up there because of bullying and anxiety issues, maybe you failed to fit in and socialize on your own, or you were born with a loner nature or the inability to understand socializing. \n\nAnd again, as much you want to say the parents failed, they don\'t have the knowledge, resources, or luxuries to help, let alone consider social dynamics for their kids. They have enough issues to deal with already, you can\'t blame them for not worrying ""about their kids\' social development enough"" neither can you call them guilty.

It's the same thing with your physical and mental health. Good health won't necessarily bring you the life you want, but it helps you to be in the best possible frame of mind for when life gives you opportunities.\n\nI recently wrote a post about my FA story, and I mentioned that I would've never met my girlfriend if I hadn't worked to overcome my social anxiety, because I would not have taken the opportunity when I saw it.

I\'m not overanalyzing everything, I\'m able to just shrug off disappointment, and overall I feel more optimistic.

I also take a multivitamin, fish oil, and magnesium.

After your oneitis rejects you and your friends try to make you feel better,,"[""When my oneitis rejected me, I had friends at the time who told me she was nothing special and there were lots of women that would want to get with me. When you have a oneitis, you think they are the one for you. My oneitis was my first woman friend at 22 and made a few more woman friends over the next couple of years who I would hang out with. Some of the women were more conventionally attractive than my oneitis but I didn't care because I convinced myself she was the one for me. After she rejected me for a far superior guy, my man and woman friends tried to make me feel better because they saw how the rejection hurt me. \n\nOne day I hung out with a woman friend and her boyfriend. I never met the guy before but he was very secure in his relationship with her. She didn't mind her having man friends. They both told me how there were lots of other women who would want to get with me. I felt better after they told me my oneitis wasn't anything special. They said there were plenty of other women who would be interested in me. I believed them and even though there actually wasn't a single woman who caused me to feel the same way than when my oneitis would compliment me, at the time, I was in my mid 20's, unattractive, but I looked the best I would ever look as an adult. I thought if I just kept being myself, I would meet other women since there had to be more women out there who liked me. There had to be women who found me attractive and wanted to get with me. Part of me doubted I would find a woman like her again and it was the closest I would come to having a girlfriend.\n\nThe year after my friend and her boyfriend talked with me, I started losing all of my friends as they were moving on with their lives and I was still my annoying, autistic, self. Eventually she ghosted on me along with any other friends I had left. Now it's been over 10 years since I had in person friends. It turns out my oneitis was the closest thing I would ever come to having a girlfriend and she was just using me for self-esteem. She was my first and only kiss. She did it out of pity. The next day she told me she was going to hang out with that guy she actually was interested in. He took her on a trip in his expensive car to the beach and they stayed there for a few days. From what mutual friends at the time told me, they had lots of sex and she bragged about the guy. A couple days later I get a call from her telling me how I'm a great guy and will find a woman for me. I wasn't mad at her and in fact, understood that I had nothing to offer her. Still, spending a couple years falling for a woman only to find out I meant very little to her hurt me. I know someone will say if she kissed you, that meant you meant more to her than you think. No, if I did mean more to her, she wouldn't have ghosted on me so easily.\n\nWow, I didn't think I would make a post this long. After lots of years, still thinking about it causes me to become emotional because that was the closest I came to escaping FA. I know I never had much of a chance but I didn't know that. I remember the feeling of companionship while talking to her all night. That will never happen again. I gained self-esteem and took better care of myself because of her. It just made the fall worse when I actually believed I had met the woman for me. The sad part is, if tomorrow after so many years she randomly wanted to be friends again, while I can easily say I would reject her wanting to be friends, in reality, I would probably hug her, and take her back.\n\nI apologize for the long rambling post.

There\'s been only one person till date, one of my two best friends, who doesn\'t bullshit around with me and admits that it\'s very hard for me to find someone, but says that the probability is not 0 (after all, he argues, in rare cases people like robert hodge and nick vujicic have found partners).', 'What does friend mean?', 'After having that happen to me I just kinda gave up on everything as a whole.

You can't just let it go as someone said. \n\nWomen can have a oneitis too but it's less common. When you are  a FA guy, you are very vulnerable to falling for a oneitis. Sometimes she knows that and uses you for self-esteem. She will flirt with you just enough to where you are crazy for her but she never gets with you.

"I know I can do better, and yet I don't.","I've just been thinking lately about how in the past I rejected the suggestions of teachers and other adults who have tried guiding me in the right path in favor of doing what I wanted to do. In hindsight, some of the advice rejected was right all along and I shouldn't have been so hard-headed.

And it makes me wonder now if I'm continuing to be hard-headed. 

I suffer from bad social anxiety, eye contact with people I'm not comfortable around is impossible, I get awkward and anxious by even the simplest of social situations, and I completely and utterly melt into flat out panic attacks in more complicated social situations. Hell, get me to talk to a girl when I'm not prepared and I'll fuck up the interaction terribly and look like a serial killer as my face reveals my discomfort.

I never admit this to people in person because, well, I'm a guy and admitting your weaknesses to other guys makes them see you as soft as baby shit. Normal people also don't understand social anxiety.

When I admit to my crippling social anxiety online I generally get flooded with advice about what I should do -- see a therapist, do rejection therapy, just put myself out there, etc.

And I can't help but feel, despite my rejection of this advice in the past, and my continued rejection of it, that they're all right, I should perhaps see a therapist, I should perhaps put myself out there socially. I know that I *should* do all these things if I want to improve, and I never will if I don't. But just like in the past when I've turned down certain advice from teachers, I continue to make the decision I'm fairly certain is wrong because the right decision scares me to death or is hard. People aren't very understanding of social anxiety, especially not when an ugly person has it, you don't get the benefit of the doubt when you start falling apart in conversation, most would just assume you're a creepy person, at least that's what I imagine every time I think of the many times I've fallen apart.

This isn't really about me getting out of loneliness, again, I know I'm ugly as sin and a boring person, nothing is going my way there. It'd just make being alive more bearable if I defeated my social anxiety, and yet I can't bring myself to even make an earnest effort to fight it.","[""i'm a guy, and i just want you to know it's okay. i think you're strong for coming clean about your insecurities. i'd understand why you wouldn't want to tell anyone other than a bunch of us strangers as a stranger yourself, but at least you aren't bottling up those feelings. still, that feeling of despair in knowing you've ignored the advice and suggestions of your teachers in the past is a rough one. i can easily relate. my life has been stagnant since i got out of high school and i've been hiding behind the diploma excuse while trying to stall out my college years as long as possible because i have no clue what i want to do or how to do it. i think in both our cases, the answer is as simple as taking things bit by bit and planning out, but even that can be a struggle. as long as you aren't at rock bottom yet though, like living on the streets, there's hope. take your time while you have it and start small. i believe in you."", 'Haven\'t read something this relatable in a while.

I guess that should only motivate me to act right in the present, but It\'s hard to know what\'s right and what\'s wrong, and to a degree, it feels too late -- I have a full-time job, a car note, bills, and a pet -- drastic changes are harder when you\'ve already started life and things like going back to college to actually get a degree feel like a window that\'s closed.', ""Do you mean how much not really listening to teachers and adults as a kid affects me, or social anxiety?\n\nI think the former kind of affected the latter. If I were mature enough to have listened to the people who knew better than me as a kid/teenager, I'd have done after-school activities, made friends, and probably gotten into a good college with a scholarship if I didn't decide to be such a rebellious loner during my teenage years. I'd have probably been able to head off my social anxiety early and more naturally if I had just listened to their advice, but now as an adult I suffer with the consequences of being a hard-headed teenager ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ I got no one to blame but myself.\n\nSocial anxiety itself affects me daily. Even doing simple stuff like shopping I turn into an anxious mess when there's multiple people around, especially if aisles are tight, or if I'm talking to a cashier. With basic interactions like that being difficult for me, you can imagine how I do when the social stakes are higher haha.\n\nIt all sucks and for the first time I find myself truly regretting some life decisions I can't take back.

A glimpse through the window at a better life.,"This happened a while ago but it has been on my mind lately. 

I was chatting with a friend from high school that I reconnected with a year ago. We were very similar growing up. Awkward, introverted anime weebs. We're still mostly the same, but one major difference is he's been in a committed relationship since 2013 and they've been living together since 2015. (If you want more context, here's my last post about him: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ev8x8g/arbitrary\_injustice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ev8x8g/arbitrary_injustice/))

Anyways, he was in the mood to offer unsolicited advice so he began telling me how you can tell if a girl is *""the one""* or not.

His girlfriend earns significantly more than him. Soon after they moved in together he was feeling guilty and depressed because of this. Thinking that he'd never amount to anything more than a service industry worker, he had a breakdown. He had a heart-to-heart with his GF, explaining his emotions.

He said to her, ""If I was better man, I would end our relationship so you wouldn't be burdened by me any longer"". He told me they were holding each other's hands at the time and when he said this to her, her hands literally became ice cold and she started balling her eyes out. She said ""Don't ever say things like that"" and hugged him tightly.

He said that's how he knows for sure that his girlfriend is the one.

I pushed this out of my mind for a while but it has come back and haunted me for the past few days. Imagine someone being so in love with you that the mere suggestion of splitting up makes their hands turn to ice. Some guys have all the luck.","[""This gave me chills somehow. How are we even enduring this, lol. I cannot even start imagining how having this kind of support would feel like. How the fuck did I manage to go through so many stuff so alone.

I just can't even imagine it."", ""Boy, I'm damn envious of your friend. He's certainly got something special there and I hope he understands how amazing she is. This is the kind of love, devotion and understanding I and the rest of us can only dream of having.

I think male FAs wouldn\'t stress out as much about family and ""aging out"" if it wasn\'t as taboo to date or marry someone significantly younger.

I was more implying about significantly older male FAs (like, 50+) where most women within their age group are reaching the point of not biologically having children anymore because of menopause.

If by chance you are a 40 to 50 year old FA but has some how managed to attract someone in their 20s (i.e. it is true love, not because of money, etc.), then more power to you.  My point is if you are in your late middle ages, you may have to date younger if you still want a family.  \n\nThat being said, I have ran into female FAs who wanted children and felt it was a race against time to find a partner before biology took over and it was no longer possible to have their own kids.  For them, their control is even much more limited, there is no option of dating younger like men since the ball is in their court because of how nature works.  \n\nThe issue of older pregnancies is controversial, I mean the term ""geriatric pregnancy"" isn\'t even used by doctors today any more.  More and more people are having kids outside of what is considered young (20s to early 30s), and a lot of times there are no problems.

Its better to not ask any girls if you are ugly,"I mean you cant do much. Its less headache this way. I am so ugly that no girl ever looks me in the eye for 1 second :( Its very sad. I didnt choose to be ugly. Why cant you just not make it obvious?  

But as a side note,I believe there must be an universal rule that, if you were an ugly guy, if a girl liked you she must ask you out, which is extremely extremely rare. This must be like, an unwritten social law. Its not fair for a girl to expect an ugly guy to open up to them. Dont you think? 

I had a girl like that before but fucking cmon. I am ugly why the hell would I ever ask you out? To make myself even more sad? That s fucking more funny than tragic.

Idk how much you\'ve actually faced rejection in your personal life, but the dating realm in this day and age is a hellish game.  \n\nAlso, in terms of ugliness, I have to completely disagree with you. You can easily get a general consensus on how attractive or ugly you are online (unless its just a badly taken photograph), there might be a few who deviate and think you\'re ugly or attractive when you could just look average, but theres always a consensus. It\'s also why people generally believe in leagues of dating, may not be as downright cutthroat while you\'re in high school, but it\'s still there. \n\nI agree that giving up because its futile is just downright degrading and depriving anyone of ever having that slight chance at a relationship, and ugliness/attractiveness does concern a bit more than just the physical, but saying being constantly rejected day in and day out isn\'t data at all ""because it\'s in the past"" just isn\'t true.', ""Thats not what I said or even implied.

I remarked that it was incorrect and to justify the future based on a weak understanding of the points of data involved was bad. \n\nIts harder than you imply not even just in some rating system. I didn't mention leagues or people of similar general level of attractiveness tending to pair. People are shown to overestimate or underestimate themselves in basically everything. Most people in here are depressed or anxious and tend to put far more weight on the negative responses or derive value from the number of tinder matches and use that as a way to designate their attractiveness vaguely. Most people aren't canvassing a collection of unbiased respondants. \n\nThis last part is a response to the misunderstanding of my point so I won't elaborate again. But knowing futility is something that would require precondition or having absolute certainty on your prospects. Most people regardless of that end up finding relationships. Not everyone of course. Butits more likely for someone to find a relationship and leave here than not. There is a reason the average age on this sub is 18 to 26 when the sub has been around for a decade.\n\nAlso I like your username"", '> I didn\'t mention leagues or people of similar general level of attractiveness tending to pair.\n\nNo, but since the topic is on attractiveness/ugliness, that\'s what tends to happen to most couples I\'ve noticed, unless you manage some wild deviation and luck out for a time. \n\n>I said it wasn\'t enough data.\n\nI mean, how much more data would you need really? Say someone on this thread has been asking women out after randomly talking to them for a bit, asking out one woman every week for a year, all turn up with rejection. 52 women. Id say that that\'s enough data to conclude that there\'s clearly something wrong, whether that\'s ""ugliness"" or lack of social skills who can say except the individual. Dating tends to be very empirical, yet there can be a general connection to be made. \n\n>Most people in here are depressed or anxious and tend to put far more weight on the negative responses or derive value from the number of tinder matches\n\nThis one I can somewhat understand, considering that all I\'ve mostly ever gotten were negative responses throughout my life, along with bullying and general rudeness from women that still somewhat permeates to this day, except now they just ignore my presence. The only positive responses I\'ve ever gotten were from family and friends attempting to cheer me up, so not really an unbiased opinion either which is even more frustrating. What absolutely flabbergasts me is using Tinder as a viable source to prove anything, tinder is the worst place to go to prove whether you\'re attractive or not since the algorithm is literally the most brutal thing out there and there\'s so much more that goes into creating a Tinder than a Facebook.\n\n>Most people regardless of that end up finding relationships. Not everyone of course. Butits more likely for someone to find a relationship and leave here than not. There is a reason the average age on this sub is 18 to 26 when the sub has been around for a decade.\n\nI\'m interested to see how you found the average on here, I tend to see alot more 30-40+ year olds than people my age and how that leads you to conclude most do find relationships, not just migrate subreddits or leave but if its true, it might be a bit more hopeful than people (including myself) think.', ""We're agreeing on that. Not sure what you're trying to say here. There are outliers. Most people pair off and most people pair off roughly within a point or so\n\nYou can't have enough data. That's the point. There FAR too many variables to make any assumption of the type unless you are specifically and willingly making choices to prevent something from happening. And not 52 women is not enough to justifiably say that something is wrong. That's not even a very high number if we're honest. But let's say you ask out more. Enough to have a reliable sample set of the population. Just as an assumption. And you're rejected every single time. Then let's say we can be reasonably certain that something is going wrong. What does that tell you about what specific thing is wrong? Alone? Nothing. You would need testimony from each woman to be certain but barring that you would at LEAST need to have isolated specific things so you could find out what was going wrong. Now let's say you do all of this and find out that something is wrong. It would be various between women what the issue was. Now what does this say about the future prospects? very little. It might be able to give you a potential probability of success. I would assume that given this wealth of information from such a thorough study you would be able to better optimize and increase that probability. But we both know that this level of information gathering is pretty much ludicrous and you can never know how other people's paths might intersect with yours and how they will affect or interact with you. In order to make any sort of accurate prediction you would need to know all of this as well as be able to know how all other people you interact with could change the probabilities. Sometimes it's just more arrogant to assume you have anywhere near the level of knowledge required to really assume you know anything about what will happen in the future. People tend to assume they'll change less than they do looking forward in time. Baseline you should just assume you don't know much about what's to come and who you'll be in 5 years.\n\nI think we're in agreement or at least mutual understanding about tinder and how people respond to external response. I definitely don't blame people for feeling this way. I get it. I really do. Whether or not something is objectively true doesn't mean much to how it feels.\n\nI haven't done a survey or anything. I just pay attention to the ages a lot on here. 30 and 40+ year olds are definitely around. But I see far more between those age brackets. I do tend to bring this up a lot thought so I think moving forward I might make a google excel sheet and keep track of ages that I see on here. I'll record usernames too so I don't accidentally record the same person twice. I'll get back to you by making a post with a chart or something after a while :) Regardless of how it turns out I hope you'll see and take a look at it.""]",https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/kh90ex/its_better_to_not_ask_any_girls_if_you_are_ugly/
I almost let my loneliness get the better of my morals tonight.,"Close friend of mine for 5 years today told me she was having relationship issues with her boyfriend of 3 years. She offered to take me home from our local mall today, since I walked there. 
I got into her car, and she drove us over to get something for lunch. Since she was driving, I bought lunch for her. She drove us to an empty lot near a lake, then started talking about her boyfriend, and how much kinder I was than him for buying lunch and being a gentleman, etc.
Then, leaning across, she kissed me on the cheek. I didn't know how to react, being socially awkward and what not, then she tried moving on further with me. I went for it for a moment, then realized what I was doing and immediately got out the car, and she looked shocked at herself and drove off.
Long story short, I was left ages away from my house after almost assisting a girl in cheating on her boyfriend. I don't know how to talk to her about it, and quite frankly, am ashamed for almost going for it.

Tl:dr bought a friend lunch after she offered to drive me home, she had a boyfriend, tried to kiss me, I almost went for it, but didn't. She drove off, now I don't know how to bring it up.","[""You did the right thing. Congrats, it sucks some times.

A lot of girls that like monogamous relationships are serial daters, meaning they don't like hooking up with a lot of guys but prefer the intimacy of one.

Things don't get better....,"I can say, I'm a late 40s FA, and there comes a point where you just want to throw in the towel. There are many reasons (as we know that can cause FA). But the bottom line is your soul eventually dies, and it is difficult to keep the physical body up around it.

I feel bad here that guys in their early 20s feel it is over for them, at my point it is truly over, missing milestones in life and being without anyone pretty much your whole life.  Then there are people that tell me I'm wrong and I can still have anything. Total bullshit. I thought making tons of money is a good cope but honestly I don't enjoy any of it. I don't even bother cashing checks...I mean, I don't care about 6 figures of money right now.  A roll of toilet paper has more value to me now. At least it gets something clean.

There is nothing better in the world than having people who care about you, having a family, a loving spouse, etc. Something I will never experience.

But this is going to be reality for the younger guys here if they don't/can't do anything. The only thing I can say is time passed very quickly. It is almost like sand thru my fingertips.

I turn 36 on the 20th of this month...Life doesnt get better when you're older,"Certainly, I can adjust the tone to make it more serious and heartfelt. Here's the revised version:

I used to carry such idealistic notions, believing that by this point, my life would have fallen into place. I envisioned a meaningful partnership, a stable relationship, and perhaps a family. Yet, reality paints a different picture. I find myself seemingly trapped in a cycle that hasn't evolved much since I was 20. With each passing day, it becomes increasingly difficult to mask my discontent, and the allure of emptiness grows stronger.

It's disconcerting how I can already foresee echoes of my future in my older colleagues. Their lives seem marked by a pervasive sense of unhappiness, as they dedicate themselves to work in order to escape their loneliness. It's unsettling to realize that I might be on a similar path, and that's a thought I struggle to bear.

Navigating the world of relationships feels like walking through a minefield. The scars left by manipulation and being taken advantage of run deep, casting shadows on any chance of trust. I've often found myself cast in the role of a backup plan, someone kept around merely for convenience. Speaking up about my feelings only seems to lead to my thoughts being misconstrued as abusive. What I yearn for is simple honesty and genuine connection.

And then there's the matter of potential partners. Could anyone truly accept me for who I am, knowing that I've never experienced a mature, adult relationship? Women my age have lived through diverse experiences – marriages, demanding careers, or lengthy relationships. Amidst all this, I feel like an outsider. How could I ever integrate into their lives?

Exhaustion is an understatement. I'm worn out by this relentless cycle. My desire isn't for a flawless partner with superficial qualities, but for a connection where authenticity is prized. A companion to share common interests, to explore life together, and to mend the gaps left by missed opportunities.

Yet, a haunting question lingers – do I deserve this? It's a constant inner struggle that refuses to subside.","['Yup, and it just keeps getting faster.

In Study 1, a nationally representative sample of persons aged 54 and older completed a telephone interview as part of a study of health and aging. Higher levels of loneliness were associated with more depressive symptoms, net of the effects of age, gender, ethnicity, education, income, marital status, social support, and perceived stress. In Study 2, detailed measures of loneliness, social support, perceived stress, hostility, and demographic characteristics were collected over a 3-year period from a population-based sample of adults ages 50-67 years from Cook County, Illinois. Loneliness was again associated with more depressive symptoms, net of demographic covariates, marital status, social support, hostility, and perceived stress. Latent variable growth models revealed reciprocal influences over time between loneliness and depressive symptomatology. These data suggest that loneliness and depressive symptomatology can act in a synergistic effect to diminish well-being in middle-aged and older adults.\r  \n\r  \n*Cacioppo JT, Hughes ME, Waite LJ, Hawkley LC, Thisted RA.

This association was independent of other well-established childhood risk factors for poor adult health (low childhood socioeconomic status, low childhood IQ, childhood overweight), was not accounted for by health-damaging behaviors (lack of exercise, smoking, alcohol misuse), and was not attributable to greater exposure to stressful life events. In addition, longitudinal findings showed that chronic social isolation across multiple developmental periods had a cumulative, dose-response relationship to poor adult health (risk ratio, 2.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-4.56).\r  \n\r  \n*Caspi A, Harrington H, Moffitt TE, Milne BJ, Poulton R.

The Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 had their mental ability assessed at age 11 and 79. Almost 500 participants also rated their life satisfaction, social networks, and support at age 80. After controlling for age-11 IQ, sex, years of education, and social class, loneliness was the only social network/support characteristic adding significantly to the prediction of age-79 IQ, explaining about 2% of the variance; in old age, increased loneliness was associated with lower cognitive ability. Social network/support factors accounted for 23% of the variance in satisfaction with life ratings, with the greatest contributions from reduced loneliness (∼12%) and having someone to talk to (∼6%). Social network/support characteristics explained a greater proportion of the variance in life satisfaction ratings compared with later life cognition, although an individual\'s level of loneliness emerged as the largest single social support predictor of both outcomes. Possible causal pathways for these associations, which need to be studied in future research, are discussed.\r  \n\r  \n*Gow, A. J., Pattie, A., Whiteman, M. C., Whalley, L. J., & Deary, I. J.

Risk of AD was more than doubled in lonely persons (score 3.2, 90th percentile) compared with persons who were not lonely (score 1.4, 10th percentile), and controlling for indicators of social isolation did not affect the finding. Loneliness was associated with lower level of cognition at baseline and with more rapid cognitive decline during follow-up. There was no significant change in loneliness, and mean degree of loneliness during the study was robustly associated with cognitive decline and development of AD. In 90 participants who died and in whom autopsy of the brain was performed, loneliness was unrelated to summary measures of AD pathology or to cerebral infarction.\r  \n\r  \n*Wilson RS, Krueger KR, Arnold SE, Schneider JA, Kelly JF, Barnes LL, Tang Y, Bennett DA.

There is no deviating from this goal and there is no ""decentering"" it to focus on myself. I've tried all my life and it only served to make me realize I cannot.

Crazy how much better just one person can make your life!,"So this January has been awful for me. I haven't felt this alone and lost before. Barely sleeping. While last January wasn't any better, Idk how I kept myself occupied.

Now coming back to two years ago. Online classes and chat groups were a thing due to covid. I had ruined my other exams and the last one was pretty important. There was a girl who was in a similar place. We had never met before but we became friends. She was really cool and supportive. We just kept checks on each other and made small study plans. This went on for months and we kept helping each other. It was good to not feel so damn lonely all the time. We mostly talked about studies and sometimes about TV shows or movies. Just flirted a couple of times but weren't any serious.

We pass the exam but keep in touch till summer of that year. It still feels like yesterday but it has been two years. Completely lost contact with her and she has moved on with her life and is at a different state in another college. But looking back wow, she made my life so much better at the time.

Do you think someone else could do better in your physical body?,"Been thinking about this lately. I’ve seen pictures of many of you and I’m surprised because many of you are above average or at least average looking and that doesn’t fit the stereotype of a FA at all.

I’m no model but I’m decent enough to have had dates and even had someone ask me out, and a few others flirt with me (I think at least).  But I’ve still never had a partner and I’m 28 going on 29. It irks me because I know someone else who looked exactly like me would have had multiple partners by now if they didn’t have my crippling anxiety or social awkwardness.  Wondering if others have had similar thoughts. I really wish I could be a normal person but I can’t. Even recently I have befriended a bartender I have a crush on and every time I go I think I’ll ask them out. But I still haven’t cuz I’m so terrified. Someone else would have asked them out forever ago. I really think mental issues are an underrated part of why many of us are FA.  In order for me to combat my issues easily I would need to look like a model and unfortunately I don’t.

But if that isn\'t demonstrated by the actions of others wanting me and pursuing me, then I am just lying to myself and believing the lies--and my actions that result from believing those lies could have devastating results that could hurt others, not just myself.\n\nAsk her out, but only if you really don\'t want to be friends with her or don\'t care about being friends with her.\n\nFor me, at least, her friendship (as distant as it might seem) would be more valuable. As long as we are active friends, I would be seen interacting positively with someone of the opposite sex. Her friendship would provide, in part and to a lesser degree, some of the basic validations that I imagine dating her would also provide.\n\nMaintaining the friendship also demonstrates to you, to her, and to others, that you respect boundaries. If you can\'t show this, you get a reputation with others as **only** concerned with being lovers, and being unable to accept something less--you can\'t respect the boundary she places on the overall relationship--and that translates into not respecting her and not respecting others.\n\nBoundaries hurt. They constrain and confine. They drown you even as you are gasping for air. But paradoxically, fighting against them and pushing against them will merely cause more boundaries to be created, and those new boundaries are even more restricting.\n\nIt is okay to want more.  It is not okay to guilt others into giving you more. It is not okay to force others into giving you more. It is only okay to express that you want more if you can demonstrate (in a way that others validate as accurate) that you will accept whatever boundaries she decides the friendship/relationship will have. If she can\'t trust that you will respect that she wants to remain friends, then you will effectively end any friendship by asking her out.', ""I mean the feeling will always be there, I guess I just look at myself in the mirror and know nobody would want to date me so there's no point in straining an otherwise pleasant relationship."", 'Protip: if you stop getting to know anyone, it gets easier to avoid women you might fall for.', 'Same.

my final attempt of living a better life.,"hey.    
for those that did not see my previous posts:    
right now im 22/m, live with (nightmare) family, and just quitted my job last week (finishing last day tomorrow. boss screwed me and i basicly rage quitted.)     
im trying to get myself up, but lately i became even more depressed. mostly cuz no gf and no anyone. if not working so just on pc like a zombie.        
would end it all long time ago if i didnt have weed.    
anyway, im trying to get myself up. to make a better and a stable life for me.        
first of all i have now around 23K if we look at $.      
1. starting a b.a at computer science. the place i chose is more of a ""learn at youre own"" mostly.
so degree will take at least 4.5 years but i will be able to work.     
2. move out ASAP (next month for sure i hope) - i cant stand my family. i feel like living here pushing me down.      
i will move to the city that my university is. rent around 500$/mo.       
3. get a cat. i need it     
4. go to dog shelters and take some doggos for a walk, i love doggos.      
5. get in shape. in the last 2 years im getting depressed more and more so i barely worked out. i want to join a MMA gym and train.     
6. live a healthier and stable life - weed like 2-3 times a week max, eat healthy, take care of myself etc.       
7. get a job like after 1-2 months of living alone and getting my shit done.  
i know all of this will probaly wont get me a gf, but maybe a life i could tolerate so i wont have to end it.

2017 is going better than expected,"Regulars will remember that I was kind of falling for this girl in my dance class around the end of last year, and basically I came to the conclusion that she wasn't interested in me. Then she went on vacation and I haven't seen her since then.

Well, it turns out there was another girl in the same class, and I kind of liked her too, but I guess I wasn't feeling as sure about it as with the other girl. I guess I would say the signals didn't seem as clear. Or something. In any case, there was someone else from the same class--also very cute and someone I liked as a person.

So it was New Year's Eve, and we're at a party together. I'm dancing with a lot of different people as I always do. I've already danced with this girl once during the course of the evening, and we talked a bit. So it's getting close to midnight, and I'm taking a little break, and nobody had asked her to dance, so she asks me to dance. Then the music stops and we go to the live countdown from Times Square. *10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1... Happy New Year!* And that's when she kissed me.

Totally unexpected, as you can imagine. I've spent every other New Year's watching other people kiss at midnight. Never really thought it would be something I'd do. Funny how life is sometimes. It was really surreal, for sure. Anyway, we danced a few more times after that and then ... yada yada yada ... We ended up having brunch together.

Anyway, I didn't want to jinx it, because too often it seems like people write these success stories too soon and it kills it, but at this point we've been going out for 2 weeks, and I'm feeling pretty good about it. Also, this is not true at all. I didn't kiss anyone at New Year's and I went home alone. Like I always do. Cool story, huh?

Its absolutely disgusting how much better goodlooking people are treated,"Me and my friends were at lunch and i was talking about an annoying girl in my class and they asked if she was hot. I said why? Then they said ""because I don't care how they act if their hot"". I just shook my head. Then they said ""Lol dude you would Fuck anything"" because I like girls they find ugly. Next their was this girl at lunch who came up and snatched one of my friends hat off and started dancing around in it. They were pissed off and disgusted calling her weird and ugly after she brought it back to my friend, yet they act weirder and say wierder things than what she just did. If she was hot they wouldn't even had cared. Then we were talking about my job and again they asked ""are the girls their hot?"" I responded in an annoyed tone ""WHO CARES?"" They will literally praise the ground a hot girl walks on and attribute every thing she does as positive just because she's hot. If I ever say anything bad about a hot girl they get pissed they don't say why, but its obvious why.

Next in my math class I was working with a group of girls who were talking about the new really attractive transfer student who was a guy. They were talking about how they wanted to get to know him and how one of their friends approached him at lunch and talked to him for a little bit, than that same girl saw him talking to another girl and stuck gum with a note on his car saying "" thanks for being a heartbreaking bitch"" Lol. The guy didn't even have to try and he had girls swarming over him. But according to normies girls don't approach guys. I bet they could just smell his ""confidence"" and ""personality"" from 10 miles away. Yet if we got a new transfer student that was ugly no girls would give a single Fuck about him unless he was rich or had high status. Its just amazing when you get to see the hypocritical normies in action irl. It just angers me that the same people who say its all about confidence and crap are the same ones who only care about looks. I can't even tell if they just refuse to admit how much looks matter except to their friends, or if it just happens subconsciously for them.

I would always chat with them and this was the first time ever that i actually enjoyed going to school.

My 8th grade year had to come to an end quickly cuz of the pandemic. I was very sad The very first time i felt happy at school had to end so soon. I enjoyed online school but i still missed school. When i returned to the buldimg i had to go to high school, We had to wear mask, I was getting friends as usual although weridly my social anixety was getting a bit worst i became more socially stupid and slow mentally. When i took my mask off nobody wanted to be my friend no more also even before taking off my mask I started getting tons of assholes doing bad things to me. I was alone majority of the time and none of my old friends even spoke to me. They kinda just moved on from there old friends One told me they were gonna invite me for lunch but never did. Some just found new friends.

I’m still alone and currently only got one friend It’s embarrassing having to be seen with barely anyone especially around a crush. Most people have been a absolute dick with me.

Working out doesn't make you better,"If you want to ""improve yourself,"" do something that makes you better: 

* Learn a new language. You'll be able to speak with people you couldn't have otherwise. You'll have a new window on a whole world that wasn't part of your life before. 
* Learn a martial art. You'll be able to protect yourself. You'll learn discipline.
* Learn to play an instrument. You'll be able to be the person who can play along when other people want to sing. You'll understand music. You'll be able to write your own songs if you want.
* Learn to code. You'll be able to make computers do things you've always wanted to do. If you get really good at it, you can make something of value that people appreciate, whether that be a website or an app or a game.
* Learn to sew or knit. You'll be able to make new clothing for yourself or alter what you already have. You'll be able to express your creativity rather than wearing stuff that's off the rack.
* Learn to do woodwork or pottery. You'll have the ability to create things that you can use. You'll be able to give people meaningful gifts. 
* Learn to create and edit video. You'll be able to put your ideas into a format that can be shared and appreciated by others.
* Read good books. You can learn more about just about anything by reading. You can take in the massive canon of literature that has been created by others. You can read non-fiction and learn all sorts of things you wouldn't otherwise know. You might even decide to write something of your own. 

All of these things can be fun. All of them are challenging. All of them make you a more interesting person capable of contributing more to the world around you. All of them involve learning. All of them involve creativity. If you take the time to do them, you will truly be improving yourself.

Working out makes you more attractive. It might make you healthier, although people don't usually focus on that--it's more of a side effect.

"Hey so, uh I don't know how to make this sound better, so I'll be forward. Y'all are probably good candidates for blood donation.","So a blood donation bus showed up at my campus the other day, and I decided to give blood. Of course they took blood pressure, stuck my finger to test cholesterol and iron, and then had a nurse give a questionnaire. 

I swear to god half the questions are about having sexual contact with ""risky populations"". About half way through with questions like ""have you had sexual contact with a person that accepts money for sex?"" I just flat out said ""I'm a virgin"". She looked uncomfortable at my bluntness, but then sat quietly for 15 seconds filling in a bunch of bubbles, then got to questions like using drugs with needles, quietly filled some more bubbles, and was done. I was good on all fronts.

They took a pint of blood and in return I got some peanutbutter crackers, sports drink and all the water I could drink, and a free t-shirt. My virgin blood was ~~used for satanic rituals~~ most likely given to someone undergoing chemotherapy, a burn ward patient, or someone that lost a pint after getting shot or something.

So if you are like me and spent your entire life up to this point not getting laid, doing hard drugs, serving overseas, or visiting Europe in the 90s, consider donating some blood.

"""It's better to be alone anyway. You wouldn't like a girlfriend""","Hello.

Two days ago, I've received another rejection from a girl I had met a couple of weeks before. I've had many, in the past, and quite a lot during the last months, but this one hit me more than the others.

She was the one who initiated contact with me. She adds me on Facebook, starts liking my pictures, sends me messages and eventually asks for my number. We then proceed to chat all night long on WhatsApp and she tells me she goes to the same class as I do so I'm like 'cool, we should have lunch together after accounting II tomorrow' and we did. 

When we met, she hugged me. During the walk from the classroom to the cafeteria, she wanted to hold my arm in hers. We started eating, and talking. After a while she looks me in the eyes and tells me ""I feel like you're a deep well just waiting for someone to explore it"" and I was flattered. That had to be one of the most beautiful things someone has ever said to me. 

I then had to go to work, but I was so happy. She seemed really interested in me. She thought I was interesting, too, it was amazing.

That night, after work, I find a text of her in my phone. She tells me something along the lines of ""It's so nice talking to you, I can't wait for our friendship to develop more!""

That was painful. I answered with ""So, is it a friendship that you want from me?"" and she told me ""Of course? Please, don't misunderstand my affection for something else. You're a friend to me, I hope that's ok :)""

I didn't reply.

Now, here's the thing. It's a simple rejection, she didn't find me attractive and yada yada. I get that. I'm used to that. Girls reject me all the time and I'm almost suprised when one of them shows any kind of interest.

But. She didn't even know me. She *looked for me* on Facebook, *added* me, *contacted me*, *asked* for my number, **just** to be my friend. I didn't even pose myself as a friend. 

It's almost as if she didn't even perceive me as a possible partner. She simply skipped to the ""he's nice let's be friend"". And this is not the first time that it happens. This year, three girls told me something along the lines of ""Don't misunderstand, I just find you nice as a friend"". She is the fourth.

Am I *so* unattractive that girls don't even see me as a male? It's almost as if I'm the gay friend of everyone. And they also feel entitled to my friendship, since they get mad as crap when I kindly explain to them that I don't want to be friend with someone I'm interested in. They almost look surprised when I tell them I'm interest. Almost as if I'm not supposed to hit on a girl.

And then, the last straw that drove me to write this post out of desperation.

I've talked about it with my best friend. Not just about this girl, but about the last year and the problems I have with girls in general. It had been at least two years since I spoke with someone about my problems, I mostly keep them to myself, but I needed someone to listen to me.

He begun telling me things like ""Just wait and you'll find the right one"", ""You're a nice guy, you'll find someone eventually!"", ""It's better to be alone anyway. Not every couple is happy"".

I know he just wanted to help me, but his words just made feel worse. 

I just... I don't know. Almost all of my friends have found someone to be with, and I just feel so lonely I can barely look at them when they kiss their girlfriend because of how jelous I am of them.

All I want is to have someone that needs me, that think about me when she goes to sleep. Someone I can cuddle with, or have some contact that goes beyond friendship. 

I am tired of being just a friend. It almost feel humiliating to have girls reaching out for me when they have a problem or they need a nice funny guy to make them laugh. Why should I give them my affection if I can't have what I want from them?

I often get the ""At least you're a nice guy and that's why girls like having you around"". But how does that help me? It just makes me feel worse. ","[""It always starts with 'friendship' in a girls mind. You screwed up a nice 'in'. Besides, girls have friends, and friends of friends, she could have been a good contact."", 'Okay dude.

"""I want to get to know you better first.""","Usually, when someone blocks you on Instagram, or you block them, any direct messages you exchanged are erased and can no longer be viewed. Somehow, within the last few hours, my Instagram account went all wonky and I could view messages from people who had blocked me (or vice versa). I pulled up an old one that made me sigh, because it reminded me of something that's happened to me too many times.

It was from the last woman I had a chance of pursuing a romantic/sexual relationship with. I felt I could just about die when she mentioned she was interested in having such a relationship with me. We had enjoyed such a warm friendship over the previous year that I definitely saw it happening. But then, after the interest was expressed, our friendship slowed down. Increasingly, my messages were being answered less. I asked her if something was wrong, 

Then came those fatal words: ""I want to get to know you better first.""

These words shouldn't be fatal – hell, they should be an opportunity. But I couldn't help but notice that, no matter what I did to propose avenues for her to get to know me better, she responded ambivalently (if she responded at all). Mind you, I wasn't doing this desperately; I was simply doing it enough to indicate the interest was still there. One night, after days of waiting for her to answer a text, I snapped. I did what is probably one of the most ""asshole"" moves I've ever been guilty of. Knowing I had literally nothing to lose, I sent her a message saying, ""Oh, can't be bothered answer my texts? Your loss, really."" She sent me an angry reply that I could barely understand (it read like a drunk text), and then I blocked her.

This is just one example, but it's been too common in my life when I've pursued women. *I want to get to know you better!* Okay, that's a fair position to take. So why is there then visible discomfort when I, oh, you know, **try to help her get to know me better?!** I used to pursue the ""I want to get to know you better"" line of inquiry with intent, but now, I give up way more easily than I used to.

If someone *actually* wants to get to know you, they don't make it difficult. If they make it difficult, then it's obvious you weren't good enough to begin with.

"Do you guys feel empty or dead inside? Like nothing really matters - no goals, not wanting a better position in professional life, stability, power, authority, progress, yada yada.","I don't feel emotions and/or hunger for anything.

I feel like that since 5 year. Started at 21 - I wanted to work hard with startups and make marketing ideas that would be ""never seen before"" and after saving up, wanted to open my own bespoke clothing business and be rich and have a cool life.

Somewhere along the way, I lost the drive. Nothing gives me energy or makes me feel anything. I don't get along with my family members at the grass root level. So, I don't care about them much either.

The only time I feel something emotionally/mentally and I want to achieve things is when I have a crush on someone I meet. I suddenly have this drive to work out, quit smoking (again), be rich, cut down on alcohol, goals in life, and just...be a better man overall. I want to make myself appealing, you know? And the moment that crush turns into a disappointment, I go back to the ""Fuck it"" state. Like - I don't want anything and I can survive with the bare minimum - a cheap studio flat, enough money to buy me food. And the whole glass becomes ""half empty"".

Eventually, I decided I had nothing to lose by giving it a shot. I was tired of the chronic pain regardless of how well I had been managing it, I'd rather be pain-free.

I can\'t count the number or times where no matter what I would suggest or way I got the same replies with the same person or unwillingness to contribute or even think about what I said.

It almost feels like he\'s trolling and wasting everyone\'s time when he\'s posting because he will always answer with the same answers over and over again. If you go into a community/subreddit telling X and the whole community states that you\'re wrong because of Y and Z, if you push the issue even more and the community gives you example of why X is wrong excluding their words, of course you will be seen as a troll. I\'m not telling thing saying you\'re a troll but it\'s an example of why you may receive this kind of treatment with others people.\n\nIt\'s like when someone say that they are fat and don\'t know why they can\'t lose weight. The instant logical reaction to this is : ""you\'re either eating too much or not exercising enough"". If the answer back from this statement is ""no I\'m fat because of my DNA"" for sure dieting/fitness communities won\'t be kind with you because in almost all cases, if you\'re overweight, it\'s because of that reason so if the members keeps saying that it\'s because of DNA and they are doomed to be fat it won\'t end well.\n\nThis goes for pretty much any discussion about anything on the internet.\n\n> Dog pile - Pretty straightforward.

Why isn't it getting better?,"Some of you will remember me. I used to post here all the time. Well, at some point, I decided enough was enough. I started making a point of being positive. And life was looking up. I genuinely felt happy. I felt like meeting a woman and getting into a relationship with her were realistic goals and that I would just meet as many women as I could and maybe it would just happen.

So I started taking dance lessons. Every day. I met so many women it was ridiculous. And on top of that, I was already meeting women before. But it was strange. I was meeting a lot of them, but just not really connecting with most of them. With one exception. 

I really thought I liked this girl. The thing is, when that happened, everything changed. I went from feeling like I was making progress to feeling like I was making the same old mistakes again. I became obsessed with her before I asked her out. Asking her out seemed impossible. I'd even get it into my mind that I was going to ask her out, but then I wouldn't be able to figure out how to do it in the moment. I got more and more attached. I had too much riding on it. Oh, and then I found out that her ""good friend"" was actually more of a ""girlfriend"".

So what am I supposed to learn from this? I'm glad I didn't ask her out. That would have been embarrassing. Obviously it wouldn't have done any good. Yes, I suppose it would have been better not to have gotten so attached to her when she's not available. 

I guess the point is that I felt like I was doing was all right. I was taking charge of my situation and trying to improve myself. And that all felt good. I was happy. I was happy right up until I met a woman who interested me. That's when all of the old habits came back and I felt like kicking myself for making the same mistakes. And in the end, she wasn't available anyway, and I'm left with that awful feeling of having to let go of a crush. I'm as single and inexperienced as ever. The best thing I have going is that maybe after some of the frustration has subsided, I can go back to that place where I'm happy despite no immediate prospects.","["">  I'm as single and inexperienced as ever.\n\nMaybe slightly more experienced.

I got a Groupon and I told them when I was going to start classes, so when I arrived on the first day of the class, I had already paid and already committed. So I bit the bullet and went. And, as it turns out, it was very structured and everyone was new, so it was fine. There are places that will take it way too fast and you'll feel stupid the whole time, but I think most dance studios start with the assumption that you don't have much experience dancing.\n\nAgain, I can only tell you from the experiences I've had, but I have met people relatively easily and made a few friends.

Remember, the guys are new at it too and some of them will be awkward about dancing. Even if they've had girlfriends or whatever, dancing is really different--it puts you in a very close space with a person of the opposite gender that you barely know.

But you aren't the only one who will have to learn and you're not the only one who will have to get comfortable with it.

I *worry* that it might feel like a lot of weight on my shoulders. I know from experience that if she says no, it is frustrating and disappointing and that feeling goes away immediately.

"Social skills are learned, and it's better to play late catch up then to give up.","I don't make my own posts often here since I have been doing much better, mostly I try to help be a FA-Normie bridge because I have been on both sides and have thought both kinda ways. But I just wanted to remind you dude/ttes this weekend of this important fact before you give up on yourself. 

A lot of us here, for whatever reason, lagged behind on developing what is probably THE most crucial human skill for success in EVERY field. I know for me, I was a really sick child and as a result I was often out of school and spent a lot of my formative years in isolation or an odd girl out. While I was more stable in middle and high school, this did its damage and I struggled to even be a group hanger on let alone even dream of being a guy's romantic interest. I was so stunted and immature I  couldn't even grasp how far behind my thinking was until years later. Even today when I'm doing MUCH better, it has left scars that I'm still sorting out with my excellent therapist (third time was the charm) - believe me, I know how much it stings and I don't want to downplay the struggle. It breaks you in your soul, because we are social creatures by nature.

The good news is -- You can get better at it. 

The scary news is -- You **need** to get better at it, or nothing will change. Flat out. Whether it's friendship, romance, or getting invited to parties, this is the biggest barrier for a good 70% of this board. Frankly, if we look at it like a game, romance is the level 50 skill and you got a fuckton to unlock first if you're only at like a Level 5 where you have some acquaintances. Thankfully, unlike so many physical things beyond our control (height, face, health, etc) this is something you can work on and make strides and improvements in.  And yeah, heads up, it is a painful and awkward journey full of landmines and cringe worthy mistakes. Most people crossed this path in middle school, but for some of us (myself included) we don't even really start until our 20s, 30s and beyond. It hurts until it doesn't. But if you have to invest in yourself in any way, please let it be this one. 

I know this is a pretty broad topic, so I'm not sure how to continue. I'd love to have a conversation about how you got stuck or behind, have you made strides at all, and any recommendations you might have for good YT channels or books that people might use as supplemental study guides for the mostly real world practice it takes to get better. I also know some of you guys have autism, and I know this an area you especially may struggle with so feel free to ask any questions or offer your thoughts too.

This raises suspicions of potential friends or potential relationships you try to pursue. They will start question about you in their minds. With relationships, you will be competing with many others, who likely will have a much better social skills and history compare to you. Much better social and life experience. In competing, your dates will compare you to others. This puts you at a disadvantage. So for these reasons, it does make it discouraging.

Anybody out there who’s really trying to better themselves and wants someone to talk to?,"So I’m 26M and currently severely depressed, probably more so than I’ve ever been in my life. But somehow just last month it’s like I woke up from a lifelong pattern of self-sabotage and realized that I have to completely change myself if I ever want a chance at being happy, and by extension, maybe one day finding someone who can care for me the way I desperately need. 

So for the past month I’ve really been doing my best to improve myself (set up a dermatologist appointment to fix my skin, dentist appointments to fix my teeth, quit smoking weed and drinking alcohol/coffee, bought weights and started a workout routine at home, started eating regularly to get myself to a healthy weight, and the list goes on), but the amount of time, effort, and money it’s going to take me to complete all these goals is pretty overwhelming and I have literally nobody to help me get through it. Not even a single friend. I talk to one person over discord, but I think they need a more normal friend, and with how depressed I am, I often don’t know how to be that for them. 

If there’s anybody out there who’s in a similar situation, whether you’ve already started your process, or you’re thinking about starting, and you could use a friend to help you, send me a message. I really need someone I can talk to and relate with, and while I need help myself, I would also be glad to help you however I can on your own path of improvement. It’s just so hard to be alone with my thoughts all the time and I know people here can understand that. 

I don’t even really care about what we talk about. Could be self improvement, but it could also be movies, music, books, video games, DnD, science, or just how horrible loneliness and depression is. Anything at all would be a huge help.

I’ve honestly always been better at speaking openly with women, but I’m happy to talk to a guy as well, as long as you aren’t the incel type who just blames women for you being alone. I fully consider myself to be FA at this point, but I recognize that it’s entirely my fault. I also want to make it very clear that I am NOT looking for anything romantic/sexual in any way. Even though it is what I crave so desperately, I am just so far from being ready for anything like that at all right now.

Yikes!\n\nExtreme social isolation is not good for human beings, sadhoppipolla. And while we FAs may find it impossible to acquire significant others or close friends, we can still associate with folks of lesser importance to us, in order to keep our loneliness and depression to a minimum.

So when they exit your life, that'll just make room for some new and hopefully better folks.\n\nThat's how it worked for me. Truly.\n\nBesides being helpful to others in need to help mitigate your own loneliness and depression, you also should NOT give up hope of someday escaping FA status, and instead maintain a robust happy fantasy life where that hope is somehow realized, at some point. That's something Nazi Death Camp survivors did, under arguably still worse conditions than most of us modern FAs are suffering. And we have all sorts of media and tech stuff to help us with that, that they did not.\n\nSaying 'no' to others when you need or want to would be one concrete step towards taking control of and improving your life, and so help your fantasy life to work, too. Doing the help thing for others would be another (and help to keep you busy as well, with less dwelling on your FA status (dwelling is bad)). But there's plenty more steps you can take.\n\nOne thing that adversely affects everyone's mood much more than most suspect is the ingestion of junk food and drink. The better a job you can do replacing that in your life with healthier stuff, the better you'll feel (at least after the initial withdrawal symptoms diminish; the stuff is truly AWFUL, like hard drugs in some ways; I suspect things like excess sugar, salt, and fat in foodstuffs or drinks will eventually be banned, or lots more heavily restricted, in most civilized nations).\n\nImprovements in physical fitness can also make you feel markedly better. So determining a regular workout routine that suits you will also improve your life, with you likely feeling significantly better within a week or two of starting it.\n\nYou can start out with as little as adding an extra 30 minutes of walking to your daily routine. But the more (and more strenuous) exercise you can regularly get, the faster and better results you'll see (however, keep in mind you have to GRADUALLY ramp up the strenuous nature of your workouts, if you're starting out from a low level of fitness, in order not to hurt yourself; so please be careful!).\n\nMy own work schedule has become more demanding the past couple years, so I've had to cut back on my own some. But I (a man) still try for a minimum 3 days a week of 60 pushups, 30 deep squats, 40 chin ups, and then 45 minutes or so of working up a dripping sweat on an elliptical machine; plus several lengthy walks to neighborhood banks and grocery stores per week.\n\nTry to make your workouts as convenient and enjoyable as possible, too. I do mine as soon as I wake in the morning (when I'm most rested). I have a music boombox, TV, and Roku set up at my elliptical machine, where I can watch Netflix while I use it, or (most commonly) listen to free Pandora music, or watch free Vevo music videos. I use the boombox radio during Pandora or Vevo commercials.\n\nBut there's more things you can do as well. Like maybe taking online classes to obtain new skills conducive to landing a promotion or a better job, for instance. Just anything, really, which might lead to bettering your conditions, or your own feelings on matters.\n\nAnd sometimes doing things like that can even result in the unexpected acquisition of a best friend or significant other, as well. And THAT possibility can also help to mightily enhance your fantasy life. :-)\n\nHowever, another tip is to only try to acquire ONE new habit at a time, and don't try to add another until the previous one is already working well. Because trying to change too much, too fast, can overwhelm you, and end up bringing all your efforts at improvements to a screeching halt.

When it comes to love and Happiness I a 22[M] has been very unsuccessful. I've never had a girlfriend or a close female friend to fill that void that I feel like I am missing in my life. And as I get older and I see more and more people in relationship, I wonder to myself, ""when is my turn?"" I want to experience the highs and lows of dating with someone. I want to grow as a person with someone. But I feel like I would never get that chance. 

Don't get me wrong, I've had my chances but for what ever reason they fizzled out or never came to be (mostly my fault). But other than that I've only had a few kisses and a one night stand that made me feel dirty and empty afterwards.


Judging on the Impression I get from other in public and on online dating apps, I am convinced I am a ugly mother fucker, with a personality that doesn't do me any favours. On top of that I believe that years of childhood trauma has hindered my ability to be intimate with anyone (Friendships or relationships) and I'm beginning  to believe I am too ugly and too broken to be saved.

Trying to Better Myself and Escape FA: Day 136,"Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/6ys98e/trying_to_better_myself_and_escape_fa_day_22/

I have not posted in a while, but I thought some users here would be interested in an update.

It's been over 100 days since I started my self-improvement ""journey"" and I can say, without a shred of doubt, I'm more happy with myself than I have been in a very long time.

I started off with small daily challenges to combat social anxiety (probably not ""real"" SAD but I'm naturally introverted and shy). Basic things like saying hello to people, smiling more, making eye contact, less Internet use, etc to get out of my comfort zone. I realized I had to get comfortable with the uncomfortable in order to improve. These things became less challenging overtime as I practiced them, and now they occur without much thought.

So what has happened and what have I been working towards since my last update? In short, I've socialized a lot more than I ever have. This semester, I found any excuse to get out of my dorm room and forced myself to try new things (like dating, parties, social events). I'm still working towards better physical health and have been going to the gym for months now. I love the benefits that an active lifestyle offers: discipline, self-confidence, and socializing. I've made some new friends and bonded really well with people by going to the gym. For once, I like looking at myself (sounds narcissistic but I disliked my body before).

As for ""FA"" matters, I've asked out a couple girls and have faced rejection. Developed a crush on a girl from classes, asked her out, hung out, but it wasn't a ""date"". Later asked her on a date, but she ghosted me. It was my first real rejection, and I got past it. Not too bad. At least I tried!

Met another girl and we hung out a few times. I asked her out and we had a nice date. Things didn't progress ""romantically"" afterwards but it was an experience for me.

To better my social life, I went to social events and partied. Met some awesome people at this one event and we socialized numerous times afterwards. I'm still in touch with them. Explored more parts of my city and filled my weekend with activities instead of binging Netflix alone (nothing wrong with Netflix, but I'd rather go out and do more real life activities).

Went to my first real party and to my surprise, I actually enjoyed it! Had nice conversations with people. I went with the intent to have fun and not expect anything (taking a girl home). Met some people there and we hung out later on.

Now, this progress seems great but that doesn't mean it's been easy. The first rejection was hard. I felt like crap afterwards but realized it's not big deal and some people aren't interested. The feeling of knowing I tried eventually overpowered the feeling of rejection.

I still get the feeling of loneliness when I haven't hung out with friends in a while, but I'm generally more happy. I look forward to the next day.

I'm looking forward to 2018. I'm looking forward to a year of trying new things and improving myself even further.

Do I feel like I'll ""escape FA""? Sure, at some point, but improving myself over these past months has focused my mind way more on doing things I enjoy rather than dwelling on being single or not. I don't go out looking for an SO, I go out to have fun and be in the moment. Sounds cliche, but that's my honest take on it.

TL;DR - Worked hard on developing myself, made friends, bonded well with people, asked girls out, got rejected, went on dates, socialized, partied, and feel better overall.","[""You're lucky that you started your self improvement journey while you're still in college .

Anyone else worry even if you do get a gf she will leave you for someone better,"I keep wondering what's stopping my gf (if I have one) from leaving me for someone better.

In my limited experience and in my mind, if I'm in love with someone (if I really like a girl) everything about her becomes perfect, even if I didn't think she was super attractive, she becomes the most attractive (personality and physically) person to me when I like her after I get to know her, and I wouldn't want her to trade her appearance with anyone else.

it's probably quite arrogant to think that this feeling is exclusive to myself, but I can't help but worry that even if I do get a gf, will she feel the same way about me? Will I become perfect if she is in love with me?

This is why I hate it when people say things like ""being rich make you attractive"", no, being rich makes your money attractive, and seems to me is a sure way to attract shallow people who will only be with you for your money, fuck that.","['Once i meet someone who doesn’t treat me like a stepping stone thing i’ll worry about them leaving or not.  \n\nIt’s a nonissue though.

I feel much better now that I have completely given up,"For a long time I wanted to be normal and have normal relationships. I was comparing my own social life with that of other people, all the time, and it made me sad because mine obviously wasn't as good.

That's when I completely gave up on finding a girlfriend. The chase is exhausting, every time your confidence takes a hit, you get your hopes up and then everything crashes, again and again.

Now I focus on the things that I like, I got new hobbies and new interests. It's better to know that it's never going to happen than to hold on to it. It might sound deceptive, but it's true. There might still be hope for some of you, but for me and a lot of people, there was never a chance.

Have you felt better since coming to terms with being FA?,"So recently I've had a change of heart on being FA. I don't believe I have the ability to change what others think of me. If I don't have any friends, It's because other people dislike me. If I don't have a girlfriend, it's because I'm fundamentally unattractive. I don't have control over that, insofar as they have the freedom to choose me and choose not to. That's OK!

Seeing as social aspects of life is basically out of my control, I've started feeling more self-confident. There are aspects of my personality that I previously hated that I now quite like. My conflict avoidance I used to think was being a pussy, but now I'm happy with not being an angry man. I used to hate my quietness, but now I realise being quiet doesn't hurt people, and it's not a vice, it's just who I am. I used to feel ashamed of my hobbies, but fuck it, I like bird-watching and drawing and writing short stories. 

One thing I've never had the confidence to do is grow my hair long. Even though I've always wanted to do so. Now, I'm fully ready to just look however I want to look. Starting with hair- I'm gonna grow it long.

I'm just going to strive to be respectful toward others, everything else however I'm going to leave up to me. Quietness, gentleness, and curiosity I don't think are vices. Even though I used to call that being a shy pussy nerd.","['way worse I used to have a lot more friends but knowing how bad my face is now I feel so embarrassed when talking with anyone', ""Well it's better than dating.

Quietness, gentleness, and curiosity are *not* vices and I'm glad you're coming to terms with that. The things you like are not bad things; they're just things you like.

I realized a little while ago - *I didn\'t ask for this*. \n\nHorrible things happened to me, either out of my control or despite my best efforts - and I am doing the best I can. I realized on that basis I have human dignity and deserve to just live a life of peace. I think I always knew that in college, when I first realized, man, I am DIFFERENT from the people around me, and it sure does feel like shit!\n\nThis is the problem though - I would still like to be someone that likes who I see in the mirror, and doesn\'t feel absolutely repulsed. In that ""Vcard, you\'re such a fucking moron, you bought lipstick that\'s gonna look ugly on you no matter what."" I want my feelings for other people - an employer, someone I want to befriend, a person I am attracted to, even someone I just want to treat me with *basic mutual respect*, like a coworker - to reciprocate. That\'s a normal thing for other people - they want something or someone, and someone says, ""Oh, you? Sure, you deserve it! You certaintly don\'t not deserve it, we\'ll give you a chance."" They get good things, and the good things *last*.\n\nI want to live like other happy people I know. No better, no worse. I do not want a ""significant"" life, to be famous, to have prestige, or to be super rich (though that\'d be nice) or expect a life free of frustration, aging, etc.I want the basic respect, camaraderie, and goodwill in the world I see other people get. \n\nI have *nothing.* I have my kin and my not-great health and no resources other than that. \n\nI finally came back to ""I didn\'t ask for this"" but I am still in trouble and live in a state of rage, isolation and sadness; I might believe I deserve peace, happiness, or a chance at certain facets of that - the problem is, nobody agrees with me. \n\nI can hate myself, or I can make peace with myself in the face of a hard, difficult world - if nobody agrees with my assessment of myself or receives my wishes to be friends, to work for someone, yadda yadda - then my life outcomes are the same. \n\nI do know what you\'re talking about though.\n\nIn order to stop hating oneself you have to stop wanting the things that ""self"" can\'t get, and I don\'t feel I ever will.

"Tbh, it's probably better this way","Why the fuck do we even want friends or partners anyway? We all imagine finding ""the one"" and loving happily ever after, but that would never happen. Even if we were to find people that tolerate our presence, people are shitty. It's pretty damn likely that they would end up backstabbing us in some way, no matter if we ever found out about it or not.

The only true way to enjoy the rest of our miserable existence on this rock is to do shit that we enjoy until our heart finally stops. Adding other people into our lives at anything more than arms length away from us just complicates things and makes it that much more likely for life to screw us over.

Friends can be alright, but never get too close to them because they WILL leave or do something to make YOU to leave. Think of them like they think of you, just another amusement until they move onto whatever they want to do next.
