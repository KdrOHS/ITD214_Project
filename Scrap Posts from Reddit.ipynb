            "Selftext: Been thinking about this lately. I’ve seen pictures of many of you and I’m surprised because many of you are above average or at least average looking and that doesn’t fit the stereotype of a FA at all. So I was thinking it has to be mental with many of us.  And even for people who are unfortunate looking it has to be mental, because I’ve seen some truly ugly people with partners.  I’m no model but I’m decent enough to have had dates and even had someone ask me out, and a few others flirt with me (I think at least).  But I’ve still never had a partner and I’m 28 going on 29. It irks me because I know someone else who looked exactly like me would have had multiple partners by now if they didn’t have my crippling anxiety or social awkwardness.  Wondering if others have had similar thoughts. I really wish I could be a normal person but I can’t. Even recently I have befriended a bartender I have a crush on and every time I go I think I’ll ask them out. But I still haven’t cuz I’m so terrified. Someone else would have asked them out forever ago. I really think mental issues are an underrated part of why many of us are FA.  In order for me to combat my issues easily I would need to look like a model and unfortunately I don’t.  I’ve seen plenty of guys who look way worse than me with partners but they’ve all been able to approach women with confidence and not be awkward. I wish I could.\n",
            "Comments:\n",
            " - For sure, also if they had a different life than me. A lot of my specific life circumstances drove me to this bad ending, so to speak.\n",
            " - Probably, but they would still be unattractive, 5ft, have a small dick etc.\n",
            " - Nope, my personality is literally the only thing people compliment me on. It’s why I’ll forever be a friend to everyone around me but nothing more. Always the bridesmaid never the bride\n",
            " - Absolutely. I'm decently attractive but my personality really gets in the way of things. I'm extremely introverted, so I absolutely dread going out socializing because I'm drained so fast. Also got social anxiety, and indoor hobbies. Combine the three and you have a socially inept hermit that loves his video games.\n",
            " - They might get out of bed, want to do activities, take better care of myself and look more presentable in general\n",
            " - Yes, definitely. This person would have to dig up out of the hole I'm currently in, but with enough confidence, it's possible.\n",
            " - My twin brother 80+ lbs heavier than me and he has better luck with women. \n",
            "\n",
            "So yea,, I think someone else can do better in my body, haha\n",
            " - Nope. I’m not attractive because I’m rather small (HEIGHT, not dick size) but I’m not unattractive. So basically I’m fucked. Not to mention I’m extremely closed off.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "I prefer taller women because I have a better chance with them in this day and age, as if i have a chance at all.\n",
            " - Surely. Just cut open my head, take me out and put someone other in my body. I don't care if that would even work. Just cut it open. I don't care.\n",
            " - If someone else had my body together with my anxiety, heart and stomach problems etc, I think they would have already killed themselves LMAO\n",
            " - i think foreveraloness is 90% mental illness and failed upbringing from parents, only a small minority are genuinely super-ugly at the extreme of the bell curve.\n",
            " - People have told me I'm attractive, not highly attractive but enough for some people to like me, I get a decent amount of matches on Tinder etc. I just never truly believe the compliments from people, I hate most of who I am. Social anxiety gets in the way and I don't talk to my matches, can't face rejection so I take myself out of the equation, hate my circumstances so I'm ashamed of admitting those too, or I'm just too anxious to relax and let my personality through. I've never asked a girl out.\n",
            "\n",
            "I think almost anyone would be better in my body than me, I am nothing but wasted potential.\n",
            " - No . I think most would have succeeded suicide\n",
            " - Maybe. I'm quite attractive while just being a 5'4\" and dress well, so as long as that person isn't struggling in navigating social & romantic dynamics like me, I think they can do quite well.\n",
            " - Probably, yes. \n",
            "\n",
            "Even though they'd still be disabled etc, I think someone else would have a much more killer-attitude. Not give up so easily, fight more to keep hobbies etc.  \n",
            "I've met some other people in a similar situation to me, and they've had a very different attitude about it all. Maybe because they had more support or something, so they felt that fighting was *worth* it?   \n",
            "I don't know, the only support I've ever had was my parents. And to be frank, they're not the most resourceful people on the planet, so they've always had an attitude of \"oh well, no use in trying that anyway\" themselves.\n",
            " - Maybe, they'd have an uphill battle, but i think they could do it. I lack both the look and a winning personality.\n",
            " - Yes, I believe someone not frozen with social anxiety, not mentally preoccupied, not gloomy and distant, etc. would almost certainly do better with our physical bodies.\n",
            " - Care to share what circumstances? If not I understand.\n",
            " - What’s his secret? Confidence?\n",
            " - Yeah I’m very much inclined to agree. Plenty of ugly people with partners.\n",
            " - I get maybe 1 match in 1 year, and last time i was rejected by a girl in a wheelchair xD\n",
            " - Maybe a friend could talk to your matches for you? You could even still dictate what you want typed. Or would you still be afraid to talk to your match on a date? Do you get any help for your social anxiety?\n",
            " - Could be a lot of things. Physical/mental abuse, racial/cultural bigotry, major life upheavals, etc.\n",
            " - He approaches every woman he sees. Every single one.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Very thick skin and determination\n",

It took me almost a year to realize how much calmer I was when I did not have to tiptoe around and get radomly yelled at or insulted.

            " - I'm 37 and can tell you that I wish I had taken my life more seriously at your age as you seem to be doing.  There are a lot of things in life that you cannot change, but you most certainly can change the composition of your body, your income levels, and your attitude.  I'm a software engineer and a CS degree is $$, hands down.  Lift weights for strength and please do take up MMA.  I'm a nogi BJJ practitioner myself (don't like the idea of head strikes for prolonged years) and if you stick with it through the injuries (1 torn meniscus and 1 torn rotator cuff), it will transform you mentally and physically.  Remove the toxic people from your life and make sure to not be one in others' lives.  Be a force for good, how you define it.  Best of luck.  It's not easy and that's why everyone doesn't do it.  22 is so young and if you keep it up (and get back up when you falter, and you WILL), you may not believe the man you will become by 30.  Bill Gates said that most people overestimate what they can do in a year and underestimate what they can do in 10.  Self-transformation and self-actualization are VERY real and every human soul has the power to reach unknown heights.  I'm rooting for you!\n",

If I talk to an attractive girl (rarely), I can't help but wonder if she would have even wasted the breath had I still been 315 pounds?

Getting muscle does not change who you are, it just makes you a more capable human being. It's in our DNA to want to continue the human race, our brains want us to mate with the most fit people possible to better those odds of surviving. So when women see a fit guy, they see a mate with good genes who will most likely spawn superior offspring, even if they don't want children it's just our nature.

Then they said \"because I don't care how they act if their hot\". I just shook my head. Then they said \"Lol dude you would Fuck anything\" because I like girls they find ugly. Next their was this girl at lunch who came up and snatched one of my friends hat off and started dancing around in it. They were pissed off and disgusted calling her weird and ugly after she brought it back to my friend, yet they act weirder and say wierder things than what she just did. If she was hot they wouldn't even had cared. Then we were talking about my job and again they asked \"are the girls their hot?\" I responded in an annoyed tone \"WHO CARES?\" They will literally praise the ground a hot girl walks on and attribute every thing she does as positive just because she's hot. If I ever say anything bad about a hot girl they get pissed they don't say why, but its obvious why.\n",

The guy didn't even have to try and he had girls swarming over him. But according to normies girls don't approach guys. I bet they could just smell his \"confidence\" and \"personality\" from 10 miles away. Yet if we got a new transfer student that was ugly no girls would give a single Fuck about him unless he was rich or had high status. Its just amazing when you get to see the hypocritical normies in action irl.

The added benefit was I discovered my love of gyms. I don't know what it is but I love the atmosphere of being in a gym around all the equipment.

So most times when I'm in social situations I would stay quiet unless talked to, which combined with my resting bitch face made me unapproachable to say the least. Someone even made a joke about me to my face for being so silent. That was kind of the last straw for me. In my line of work I find myself occasionally having to make small talk with people so I decided to use these moments to practice and get more comfortable. When to ask questions, when to put in my own anecdotes, how to make the right amount of eye contact, etc. All those things that should be second nature but for me I had to make the conscious effort to do. Over time for me though it did become second nature. I'm not the most bombastic person you'll ever talk to and I still hate getting into conversations with random people, but I'll at least hold my own now when carrying through social situations.\n",

Hes 10 years younger than me so I dread the idea of him bringing the girl to introduce cuz i know everyone is looking at me wondering why i at 26 havent brought a girl to the house. My older  sister is already married with kid. My little brother has a girlfriend. Hes never asked about my relationships and neither has my sister but I'm sure they both know that I'm just a loser. I'll happy for him but at the same time I'm pretty sad that I'm the only one of my sibling to be such a loser. I knew it since he was only like 6 that he would probably get a girlfriend b4 me. Now that it actually has happened I'm pretty sad. My parents are the only one that dont understand why I'm single. But I guess their generations wouldn't get it. How do I cope with being the black sheep of the family.\n",

But unfortunately, life *is* just one big competition most of the time so if i had to guess i'd say almost everyone is superior to me. I have one brother (2.5 years older than me) who i often think of as the complete opposite of me.

He's less careful with his appearance, less sociable than me, more reserved and even more shy I'd say, yet, seems like the two relationships he's ever had fell from heaven. He didn't even try.

The fact that it took until I was 28, I had to pay someone to do it and that I couldn’t even finish either time didn’t really make me feel much better after the initial boost. In fact I still feel like a virgin. What I really want is a girlfriend not just sex so I’m still just as depressed. Wondering if anyone had better experiences.\n",

            " - No! I couldn't get it up! I was too nervous and I didn't found her sexy at all. Worst $75 spent ever. Could've bought some fine LSD with that. It was on Cuba and I basically took that trip to fuck, so you can imagine how it was like to return and lie to my friends about it. 0/10 nothing can trump the real thing\n",
            " - came across a high school chick i used to know dancing on the poles.We chatted for awhile and she ask if I had money in exchange for some goodie goodie couldn’t refuse the offer it was weird but I got my moment of pleasure and moved on.\n",
            " - Yes and no. I lost mine at 25 abroad. I never really expected it to be a big deal. I didn't expect it to change me as a person. The experience wasn't great, I didn't last long. But the experience also wasn't bad. In some ways I still felt like a quasi virgin, like I'd had sex but also not really. \n",

            " - I'm at a point where I'd take a girlfriend that refuses to do anything more sexual than a handjob/fingering, but does like cuddling and is a really close friend over sex with an escort or even a one night stand for free. I crave real intimacy and I don't believe that sex with a stranger is all that intimate.

Of course I’ve only ever been unable to finish considering I’ve had sex a grand total of twice and it was with the aforementioned SWer both times lol, so maybe I guess I can’t say for sure.  How old are you now? Have you had any more luck since losing your virginity?\n",
            " - It is expensive and you absolutely will catch feels if you’re attracted to her. Source: I caught feels.\n",
            " - The first time i was in my early 20s, she came to my house, looked nothing like her pics (way chubbier) She made me turn off the light and wasnt allowed to see or touch her tits (she let me grab her ass while she blew me.) It was very awkward and hard to cum. The second time i was in mid 20s and it was a similar experience except that she was hotter than the pics and it was at a hotel. Still awkward, still hard to cum. The first girl i think what went wrong is i had my hopes too high/didn't know what to expect. The second one i think i was just too nervous to perform\n",

            " - Sorry to hear that. At least the second time sounds like it wasn’t all bad. My experiences were more like your second experience. And tbh at this point she might be the only girl I ever have sex with. She was cute and cool but I still was super nervous both times and honestly just made me sad because I still couldn’t have what I really want (true intimacy).\n",
            " - Have you found anyone? Even after having sex I still have pretty much given up.\n",
            " - Tbh if you’re nervous it doesn’t make much of a difference if you find her attractive or not. Source: I was attracted to the person I had sex with and couldn’t finish either time.  To be quite honest Idk if I would have been able to finish even if she was 2000 Jennifer Lopez. I was that out of it. I wish I could practice with a girlfriend so I could get over it lol.\n",

            " - Mental health issues and self hatred which is caused by said issues. It’s incredibly hard for me to talk to women in a romantic sense and I can’t initiate physical contact. Been on some dates but they never go anywhere. Hbu?\n",
            " - Has a woman ever liked you enough for a second date/have u ever kissed these women? Personally I have never gone on a date and I have never even asked a woman out. (Too scared) My problem(s) is that i am too ugly, have nothing really interesting about me, and I honestly am too shy to talk to random people (not just women) so there's no chance i even can accidentally get a woman bc im way too scared to even talk to them\n",
            " - I’ve been on two second dates. Couldn’t get a third either time even though I really liked both of them. I have been kissed but not since I was 18 (29 now).  I used to think looks were holding me back too so I would encourage you to reevaluate that and see if it’s actually the case. I eventually realized fear and mental illness is what hurts me most. If you can work on these things you can (theoretically) find someone even if you’re not great looking. I’m certainly no model but someone else could do way better than I did in my physical body.  I’ve seen unattractive guys with girlfriends enough to know it’s possible.  Obviously what I talk about is extremely difficult for guys like us or else I wouldn’t be on this sub but I don’t want you to give up (hypocritical of me lol).\n",

I got a Groupon and I told them when I was going to start classes, so when I arrived on the first day of the class, I had already paid and already committed. So I bit the bullet and went. And, as it turns out, it was very structured and everyone was new, so it was fine.

Remember, the guys are new at it too and some of them will be awkward about dancing. Even if they've had girlfriends or whatever, dancing is really different--it puts you in a very close space with a person of the opposite gender that you barely know. At first, everyone is trying to figure out how far apart they can stand. You get used to it. It takes time.

Keep trying, and next time you want to ask a girl out, just put your thoughts on hold and let your mouth do the work. People will say that this is \"easy to say and hard to do.\" I don't agree.

I feel like I'm making myself better and I feel better about myself. I feel like if I were to meet a woman, I'd do all the right things. But then I actually *do* meet someone, and it's all about timing. I get the opportunity to ask her out, but....the thing is, when I feel that way around someone, I want to keep that feeling going. It's so nice to feel that way. I just want to *have* it--to savor it. I know that if I ask her out, that feeling will change. True, she might say yes. Honestly, I'm not sure what that would feel like. I *worry* that it might feel like a lot of weight on my shoulders.

While I was more stable in middle and high school, this did its damage and I struggled to even be a group hanger on let alone even dream of being a guy's romantic interest. I was so stunted and immature I  couldn't even grasp how far behind my thinking was until years later. Even today when I'm doing MUCH better, it has left scars that I'm still sorting out with my excellent therapist (third time was the charm) - believe me, I know how much it stings and I don't want to downplay the struggle.

Frankly, if we look at it like a game, romance is the level 50 skill and you got a fuckton to unlock first if you're only at like a Level 5 where you have some acquaintances.

With relationships, you will be competing with many others, who likely will have a much better social skills and history compare to you. Much better social and life experience.

But I have noticed since I've started trying to feel more self-confident that seeing other people happy effects me a lot less. To the point now where I'm happy for them.\n",
            " - This. My mind is deteriorating badly. Every time i look on social media or go out and see people together enjoying life it triggers me. People aren't meant to be alone for long periods of time it's horrible for mental health\n",
            " - Yeah the Agoraphobia and general anxiety issues is going to be a pain in the arse. I'm viewing it as my life's penultimate challenge. FA, well, again- I can't control that a whole lot. Socialising is a group effort, and if the group doesn't want me taking part there's little I can do. \n",

If that person beneath the rust is repulsive to the world then so be it. I have no control over the world- I refuse to burden myself with any notions of the contrary.

            " - If there was, the worlds a big fucking place and the chances of me meeting them are nil. Plus I have an anxiety disorder which prevents me from being mobile at all. I'm confined to whatever area I consider \"home\", and little beyond that. Though that's something I'm working on. I've never been looked at fondly by people in a romantic sense, not even in a friendly sense. I've got 4 years in Uni, so I could get lucky there, but beyond some kind of forced social environment meeting people is... well, not feasible with my mental health status.\n",

            " - There’s ways to make yourself more attractive and confident. Stop jumping to conclusions without trying.\n",
            " - There are, but even with all the effort in the world it wouldn't result in relationships or friendships. I'm talking about myself there, obviously I can't say that for other people.\n",

            " - People aren't really capable of \"strong relationships\" anyway, too many ulterior motives and all that. Every relationship is built on the lie that the person on the other end actually likes them, instead of the benefits the other person gets for being in said relationship.\n",
            " - That's a cynical but often true view to hold. However I personally have hung out with people where neither has an ulterior motive and simply enjoy the company. Yet my case might be an anomaly because i have seen what you describe more often lol. I still think its wise to keep the option open for true friendship and even romance though, just not to expect it :x\n",
